Even though the various therapeutic potential of metformin treatment has been reported, as well as the improvement of insulin sensitivity and glucose homeostasis, the mechanisms underlying those bene ts are still not fully understood. In order to explain the bene cial effects on metformin treatment, various metabolomics analyses have been applied to investigate the metabolic alterations in response to metformin treatment, and signi cant systemic metabolome changes were observed in bio uid, tissues, and cells. In this review, we compare the latest metabolomic research including clinical trials, animal models, and in vitro studies comprehensively to understand the overall changes of metabolome on metformin treatment. Keywords: metformin; metabolomics; T2DM; metabolome; BCAAs; TCA cycle 1. Introduction Metformin (N,N-dimethyl biguanide) is a rst-line anti-hyperglycemic medication for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), particularly in overweight or obese patients, by lowering the glucose levels and improving insulin sensitivity [1]. Clinically, metformin treatment reduces body weight and adiposity, and positively affects glucose homeostasis in T2DM patients [2]. The discovery of metformin is derived from galegine, a natural product isolated from the medicinal plant Galega of cinalis (Goat s rue), which has been traditionally used in Europe [3]. Galegine, a guanidine alkaloid containing an isoamylene, is known to enhance glucose uptake and inhibition of acetyl-CoA carboxylase and is thus expected to contribute to the weight-reducing effect [4]. However, G. of cinalis is toxic to animals, shown through accidental livestock poisoning in the eld as well as laboratory studies. Additionally, galegine is believed to be the major toxin of G. of cinalis and causes blood pressure lowering, paralysis, and death in sheep [5]. Metformin is structurally modi ed from galegine containing a biguanide moiety (Figure 1). Interestingly, this small modi cation decreased the toxicity, but still keeps the glucose lowering effect [6]. Pharmacokinetically, metformin does not undergo hepatic metabolism, so it is considered safe from a hepatic standpoint, and metformin-induced hepatotoxicity is very rare, with less than 20 cases having been described over several decades [7]. Various clinical studies also supported the safety and tolerability of metformin treatment [8 10]. Thus, metformin has been used for almost 70 years to treat T2DM patients with its safety and clinical usefulness. Chemically, metformin is a hydrophilic base, which exists as a cationic species at a physiological pH. Regarding this poor lipophilicity, passive diffusion of metformin through cell membranes is limited; thus, its uptake and distribution crucially rely on the organic cation transporters (OCTs) which are expressed at signi cant levels in metformin target tissues such as liver, muscle, and adipose tissue. De ciency or inhibition of the OCTs impairs the uptake of metformin in the small intestine and the hepatic uptake and elimination and attenuated antiglycemic effect by metformin treatment [11 14].

Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2021, 22, 10275 2 of 15 Figure 1. Galega of cinalis (Goat s rue), galegine, and metformin. The mechanism of action of metformin is complex and still not fully understood [15]. Traditionally, it is accepted that the anti-hypoglycemic activity of metformin is involved in the suppression of hepatic gluconeogenesis [16 18]. In the liver, metformin regulates mitochondrial respiration by inhibiting the mitochondrial respiratory-chain complex 1 and activating the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) in hepatic gluconeogenesis [19,20]. Metformin also increases AMPK activity and insulin-stimulated glucose transport in skeletal muscle [21,22]. However, contrast results were also reported from several studies where hepatic gluconeogenesis increased in nondiabetic patients and recent-onset T2DM patients, indicating the mechanism of action of metformin may be extra-hepatic [23,24]. Recently, the intestines are another target of metformin by increasing anaerobic glucose metabolism in enterocytes to reduce glucose absorption and increase lactate delivery to the liver [25]. Gut microbiota, such as Akkermansia muciniphila, Escherichia spp., or Lactobacillus, and their composition has been altered by metformin as well [26,27]. Even though the mechanisms of drugs have been revealed, with a revolution in biomedical research that resulted in remarkable therapeutic advances in drug development, various responses from patients to a drug treatment are still challenging [28]. For example, metformin treatment was considered to have failed to control glucose levels in approximately 15% of patients [29,30]. Age, sex, environment, nutrition, microbiome, and other internal/external factors can impact the drug response of individual [31 33]. From the perspective of precision medicine, interpretation and prediction of the biological phenotype including drug responses or side-effects are becoming an important concern in medication [34]. Discovery of the biomarkers and development of diagnostics for the prediction require ef cient computational tools and a substantial number of samples. To achieve those, metabolomics research has been concerned. Metabolomics is a systematic study of the unique chemical ngerprints based on the high-throughput identi cation, quanti cation, and characterization of the small molecule metabolites in the metabolome, which is the complete complement of all small molecules found in a speci c cell, tissue, organ, or organism [35]. Here, we discuss the recent research understanding the effect of metformin and their metabolism, mainly focusing on metabolomics approaches (Figure 2). In addition, we will review the potential biomarkers of metformin treatment and the relationship between metabolites.

Metabolomics Metabolomics is the large-scale identi cation and quanti cation study of all targeted metabolites within cells, bio uids, tissues, or organisms under speci c conditions or diseases [35]. These metabolites are small molecules within a mass range of 50 to 1500 Daltons, and their interaction within a biological system are known as the metabolome, which is de ned as the collection of the metabolites as well. Endogenous metabolites such as sugars, lipids, amino acids, fatty acids, nucleic acids, or organic acids are typically produced from the metabolism and considered as targets of metabolomics study. In the central dogma of biology, metabolites are the downstream summation of DNA, RNA, and proteins, which means any change in these molecules affects the metabolomes, as well as the changes in environment such as diet, exercise, mental stress, and disease [36]. In other words, metabolic pro ling is to take a snapshot of the physiologic status of a biological system, and the metabolome changes inferred the relation between the genome (DNA), transcriptome (RNA), proteome (proteins) and biological phenotypes such as drug response or side effects [37]. Various analytical platforms and technological advances have allowed researchers to detect, identify and quantify thousands of metabolites from complex bio uids. Mass spectrometry (MS) and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) are the most common analytic platforms with complementary usefulness in various metabolomic studies [38,39]. MS gives information about molecular weight while also identifying and quantifying the compounds under analysis. MS is frequently coupled to liquid chromatography (LC) to establish an LC-MS platform, or gas chromatography (GC) to establish GC-MS, which are powerful analytical techniques that combine the physical separation of chromatography with highly sensitive and selective mass analysis of MS. This hyphenated platform enables the simultaneous and integrated analysis of hundreds of metabolites in complex samples with high sensitivity and selectivity. A liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) platform, where triple quadrupole mass spectrometers (QQQ) or quadrupole time-of- ight (QTOF) is integrated, is the most commonly used platform. However, MS cannot detect all metabolites, as some metabolites do not ionize with certain ionization methods. So, the number and class of metabolites that can be detected by MS depends on the choice of ionization mode. Compared with MS, NMR spectroscopy is a quantitative and highly reproducible analytical platform providing information of metabolites in almost all bio uids, tissues, cell extracts, or even live cells, as well as being a non-destructive analytical technique. The types of molecules do not in uence the NMR results as well. NMR-based metabolomics gives useful information about the presence/absence or the number of metabolites in a biological system and enables monitoring the ow of compounds through metabolic pathways. For instance, around one hundred metabolites in

Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2021, 22, 10275 4 of 15 human urine were identi ed and quanti ed by analyzing 1H NMR-based metabolic pro les, providing the effects of feeding and body-weight loss in energy metabolism [40]. Two-dimensional NMR experiments such as 1H-1H correlation spectroscopy (COSY), 1H13C heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC), and total correlation spectroscopy (TOCSY) are used to identi ed complex bio uid mixture as well. The low sensitivity is a weakness of NMR but can be improved with higher eld strength, cryoprobe, and dynamic nuclear polarization techniques. Metabolomics study is typically classi ed into two categories: targeted and untargeted metabolomics [41]. In targeted metabolomics, clearly de ned and selected compounds are analyzed and compared from different sample groups. This approach involves the measurement of identi ed and chemically de ned compounds, which is related to the metabolic pathway or hypothesis. Therefore, unknown or non-targeted metabolites are not considered. On the other hand, untargeted metabolomics mainly focuses on the global consideration of both known and unknown metabolites for comprehensive analysis to detect and gure out an alteration from different conditions in order to identify and relatively quantify the metabolites with different contributions in terms of classi cation, for example, healthy and diseased. Novel metabolism or metabolic pathways can be revealed from the changes in metabolic pro les. However, identi cation of signi cant peaks remains a challenge, complicating in-depth mechanistic or biochemical understanding. In the pharmaceutical science eld, pharmacometabolomics has arisen from the metabolomics research eld to achieve enhanced and systemic understanding of mechanisms for drug or xenobiotic effects and improve the ability to predict individual variation in drug response phenotypes based on using both baseline metabolic pro les prior to treatment and also the effects of drug treatment overtime [42]. Clinically, pharmacometabolomics is anticipated to enable precision medicine given by monitoring drug response and treatment outcomes, nding novel response pathways or biomarkers, and combining with pharmacogenomics for understanding drug affects [43]. 3. Plasma Metabolome and Metformin Treatment The de nition of plasma is the clear, straw-colored liquid portion of the blood that remains after red blood cells, white blood cells, platelets and other cellular components are removed. It is the single largest component of blood, comprising over half of the volume, and various classes of metabolites with different chemical properties are in the plasma. Changes in plasma biomarker concentrations are not necessarily related to speci c organs or tissues and can be the product of a systemic response [44]. Thus, plasma metabolomic pro les are widely used in various disease studies such as T2DM [45], chronic kidney disease (CKD) [46], cancer [47], malaria [48], obesity [49], depression [50], hypertension [51], and Alzheimer s disease [52], providing new insights into systemic mechanisms underlying the pathophysiology of the diseases. Currently, around four thousand metabolites have been detected or quanti ed, and twenty thousand metabolites are expected to be present in human blood [53]. 3.1. Effect of Metformin Treatment in Non-Diabetic Condition Metformin treatment in non-diabetic status in uenced the various metabolite levels in blood. Cai et al. [54]. performed a one-self control study with a metformin tablet of 500 mg twice daily and compared the plasma metabolite pro ling in 20 healthy volunteers before and after metformin treatment for 7 days, showing signi cant difference in endogenous metabolite pro les using LC-MS. The levels of four lysophosphatidylcholines (LPCs) including 16:0 LPC, 18:0 LPC, 18:1 LPC, and 18:2 LPC of metformin treatment groups were obviously decreased compared with the control group, which indicated metformin regulates LPC levels in plasma and improves lipid metabolism. Dahabiyeh et al. [55] performed an MS-based untargeted metabolomics approach to investigate the metabolic changes associated with the administration of a single dose of metformin (500 mg) in 26 healthy subjects. Among the endogenous metabolites, 5-aminopentanoic acid, propi Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2021, 22, 10275 5 of 15 onic acid, hydroxymethyl uracil, and ethyl phenyl sulphate signi cantly increased, and metabolites involved in arachidonic and linoleic acid metabolisms, glycerophospholipids, and eicosanoids decreased. Their results pointed out that the roles of metformin could be associated with fundamental biochemical processes such as lipid network signaling, energy homeostasis, DNA repairing, and gut microbiota. Branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs), namely isoleucine, leucine, and valine and aromatic amino acids (AAs) showed a strong association with future diabetes as well as obesity and serum insulin level [56 58]. Preiss et al. [59] focused the metabolic shift on circulating amino acids in response to metformin treatment (1700 mg, daily) in 173 individuals without T2DM, but with coronary disease from the Carotid Atherosclerosis: Metformin for Insulin Resistance (CAMERA) randomized controlled trial study, and observed the increase in alanine and histidine levels, the decrease in tyrosine and phenylalanine levels, and no changes in BCAA levels in plasma by 1H NMR data analysis, but those changes of aromatic amino acids and alanine levels were not related to the body weight and insulin sensitivity. Walford et al. [60] also reported no changes in BCAA levels and the decrease in tyrosine level in the plasma from 30 insulin-sensitive subjects with 2 days of metformin treatment (500 mg, twice daily) by LC-MS analysis with a hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography. Rotroff et al. [61] performed LC-MS-based non-targeted pharmacometabolomics analysis to investigate the effect of metformin (1000 mg for the rst day and 850mg for the second day) in 33 non-diabetic African Americans and reported several metabolic alterations with indole-3-acetate, 4-hydroxyproline, and 2-Hydroxybutanoic acid, revealing that metformin was associated with the urea cycle and purine metabolism. The signi cant decrease in ornithine and citrulline levels in plasma indicated that metformin administration was related to the mitochondrial complex I, the primary target of metformin. Interestingly, 2-Hydroxybutanoic acid was positively correlated with fasting glucose levels as well as glucose levels following oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) after metformin treatment in their study. However, there were no signi cant changes in BCAA levels. Gormsen et al. [24] carried out a randomized, placebo-controlled trial in 24 subjects with recent-onset T2DM and 12 non-diabetic individuals with metformin administration (1000 mg twice daily) for 90 days. In the study, the metabolic pro le in the plasma was analyzed by non-targeted metabolomics research, and 882 named biochemicals were identi ed by using LC-MS and GC-MS. In their study, no signi cant alteration in BCAA levels was observed, and a decrease in tyrosine was shown. Table 1 shows the signi cantly altered plasma metabolites and related metabolism in response to metformin treatment, which is reported from multiple studies. Most metabolites showed similar trends in different studies without hippuric acid, hypoxanthine, and arginine. This difference might be from different environments, nutrients, or other internal/external factors. Table 1.

Effect of Metformin Treatment in Insuline-Resistant Condition Various studies reported the effect of metformin on the plasma metabolome pro les associated with obesity and T2DM cases as well as blood glucose level (Table 2). Gormsen el al. [24] reported that metformin treatment (1000 mg twice daily) altered the metabolic pro les and found that fasting plasma glucose level decreased in only the metformin-treated T2DM group, and 1,5-anhydroglucitol (1,5-AG) was associated with a glucose-lowering effect in response to metformin administration. Huo et al. [62] compared the biochemical changes in the serum of 35 T2DM patients with/without the treatment of metformin (the dose was not described) for 3 months using 1H NMR and UPLC/MS analysis and observed the elevation of trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO), 3-hydroxybutyrate (3-HB), and tryptophan, and the reduction in acetoacetate, unsaturated lipids, and LPCs (C16:0 LPC, C18:0 LPC, and C18:2 LPC). Among the altered metabolites, TMAO is related to the gut microbiota metabolism, so its alteration indicated an intestinal bacteria regulation function of metformin. Xu et al. [63] analyzed both metabolomic and genomic data of the population-based KORA cohort and studied the effects of metformin on metabolite pro les and LDL cholesterol in T2DM patients to discover metformin treatment-associated metabolites (the dose was not described). Among the 130 metabolites in fasting serum, three metabolites, including three phosphatidylcholine acyl-alkyls (PC ae C36:4, PC ae C38:5, and PC ae C38:6), which are composed of at least one polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) remained signi cantly different in the comparison between metformin and control groups. Those metabolites are involved in the AMPK pathway associated with FADS1 and FADS2 genes. Adam et al. [64] carried out a further cohort study with LC-MS-based non-targeted metabolite pro le study, reporting that a signi cant lower plasma citrulline relative concentration was observed in the metformin treatment group. Additionally, ornithine, urea, and arginine concentrations were lowered in human serum. This phenomenon was also observed in the diabetic mice model following daily, subchronic metformin treatment (300 mg/kg/day) compared with the control mice. Lower citrulline results were also observed in murine skeletal muscle and adipose tissue, but not in the liver. Breier et al. [65] also reported the immediate and sustained reduction in the serum citrulline level after initiation of metformin (500 1000 mg daily for the rst dose, 1000 2000 mg daily for 4 to 6 weeks) in T2DM patients by using LC-MS, but the serum steroid pro le was not altered. Another randomized, double-blind, placebo, controlled study from Irving et al. [66] reported the lowering of citrulline and arginine concentration in the pioglitazone-metformin combination therapy (45 mg of pioglitazone daily plus 1000 mg of metformin twice daily). Those results announced that the urea cycle could be downregulated by metformin.

Metformin treatment also affects BCAAs, including leucine, isoleucine, and valine, and AAs, including tryptophan, tyrosine, phenylalanine, and histidine levels, in insulinresistant conditions. The metabolism of certain amino acids is related to insulin-resistant states, so glucose-lowering medications could alter amino acid concentrations as a downstream consequence. In the insulin-resistant cases, BCAAs were signi cantly affected by metformin, but the response was different in humans and mice. Safai et al. [68] analyzed 87 plasma metabolites in 370 participants with T2DM from a randomized (1:1 of metformin or placebo treatment) study using LC-MS, and reported that higher levels of leucine/isoleucine and lower levels of carnitine, tyrosine, and valine were observed in T2DM participants treated with metformin (1000 mg twice daily) over 18 months, but there was no correlation between the markers and HbA1c levels. Huhtala et al. [67] measured the serum concentration of alanine, glutamine, glycine, isoleucine, leucine, valine, histidine, phenylalanine, and tyrosine along with glucose and lactate in women with gestational diabetes mellitus treated with metformin (500 mg daily and increased to 2000 mg daily if needed) or insulin by analyzing 1H NMR spectroscopy data and observed the rise in alanine, isoleucine, and lactate in the metformin group compared to the insulin group. Walford et al. [60] reported acute increases of BCAAs and AAs following metformin treatment in insulin-resistant subjects. On the other hand, opposite results were reported in an LC-MS-based T2DM mice model study with metformin treatment (250 mg/kg/day), in which carnitine (butyrylcarnitine, acetylcarnitine, and acylcarnitine C18:1) levels increased and isoleucine concentration decreased [69]. Sonnet et al. [70] also observed that metformin treatment (0.1% w/w ad libitum) reduced serum BCAA levels in the murine model of maple syrup urine disease by analysis of the LC-MS pro le. These results were consistent with the study of Zemdegs et al. [71], where metformin treatment (300 mg/kg/day) reduced circulating BCAA levels in insulin-resistant mice. The reason why those responses from humans and mice were different is unclear, but it might be related to the difference in metformin transportation by organic cation

Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2021, 22, 10275 8 of 15 transporters (OCTs), which play a role in the hepatic and renal transport of metformin, and their distribution varies immensely among species [13,14,72]. Additionally, the much higher dose of metformin treatment in animal models than in humans could also make it dif cult to translate the results from rodents to humans. The plasma metabolome from metformin treatment reveals the relevance between metformin and purine metabolism. According to Jenkins et al. [73], several intermediates of purine breakdown were signi cantly elevated in T2DM mice with metformin treatment. After ve weeks of the treatment, xanthosine, inosine, and urate signi cantly increased in a dose-dependent manner, but candidate tissues that are primarily responsible for the systemic changes were not speci ed. On the other hand, the signi cant decrease in inosine and hypoxanthine in serum samples were reported from non-diabetes mice treated with metformin [61]. 4. Urinary Metabolome and Metformin Treatment Urine is the most commonly used specimen in metabolomics with its ease of collection and sampling [74]. It is plausible that metabolites in the urine are end products of the biological system and are linked to biological phenotypes. Identi cation, quanti cation, and following analysis of urinary metabolites have been studied for diagnosis, health monitoring, and drug metabolism [75]. Urine sampling is non-invasive and requires less pre-treatment than other bio uids due to its low protein content and less chemical complexity. However, sample collection should be performed in a consistent manner because the individual metabolite pattern in urine can be highly affected by various preanalytical factors, including day and time of collection, physical activity, fasting/feeding, and many other factors [76]. According to the HMDB database, over 2600 metabolites have been identi ed or quanti ed from urine, and new biomarkers or metabolites have been discovered by the improvement in analytical technology. 4.1. Effect of Metformin Treatment in Insuline-Resistant In Vivo Models According to Pelantov et al. [77], urinary metabolomic pro les in mice with obesity and T2DM changed after treatment with metformin (250 mg/kg daily), in which signi cant changes in several amino and aliphatic acid derivatives were detected by analysis of 1H, 1H-1H COSY, and 1H-13C HSQC NMR experiments. Among the metabolites, N-carbamoyl -alanine level was signi cantly decreased by metformin and its decrease indicated the ef cacy of the metformin therapy in an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). Dong et al. [78] carried out a urinary metabolomic pro ling study in Zucker diabetic fatty (ZDF) rats in response to metformin (200 mg/kg/day), glimepiride (5 mg/kg/day), and their combination using LC-MS analysis. From partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) of urine metabolic pro les between control, ZDF model, and ZDF-metformin groups, three metabolites, including citric acid, sphingosine, and succinoadenosine, were found signi cantly reverted to normal levels after metformin therapy. Pan et al. [79] reported the LC-MS-based urinary metabolomics study of the hypoglycemic decoction and metformin (100 mg/kg/day) in a T2DM rat model, revealing the reduction in tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle-associated metabolites, including citrate, isocitrate, and cortisol, and the elevation of phenylalanine and 1-methylhistamine. The other urinary metabolomics research reported similar results, where metformin treatment signi cantly in uenced the suppression of TCA cycle metabolism. According to the NMR-based metabolomics study of Maulidiani et al. [80], four metabolites, citrate, alpha-ketoglutarate, succinate, and fumarate, decreased in T2DM rats, and their concentration levels were further reduced after metformin treatment (300 mg/kg/day), which meant metformin suppressed the TCA cycle. Zhu et al. [81] reported the signi cant reduction in pantothenic acid and malic acid in metformin-treated mice (250 mg/kg/day) by using LC-MS analysis, meaning the suppression of the TCA cycle. Metformin treatment also improved the glucose (decreasing D-glucose) and nucleotide metabolism (decreasing 1-methylnicotinamide). Gut microbiota-produced metabolites including trimethylamine (TMA), phenylacetylglycine (PAG) and indoxyl sulfate levels

Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2021, 22, 10275 9 of 15 were observed in the urine, revealing the increased growth or activity of gut microbiota by metformin treatment. Mediani et al. [82] performed NMR-based untargeted metabolomic analysis to understand the biochemical changes in streptozotocin (STZ)-induced, normal-, and obese-diabetic rates with metformin treatment (150 mg/kg/day), suggesting that metformin may provide better improvement for T2DM complications and insulin sensitivity for obese diabetes rather than normal diabetes. Lee et al. [83] also carried out an LC-MS-based untargeted urinary metabolomics study in diabetes and prediabetes rat models, revealing the alteration of urine metabolomes. For prediabetic rats, metformin treatment (250 mg/kg/day) altered the urinary metabolite pro le to be more like that of healthy rats (Table 3). Table 3.

Effect of Metformin Treatment on Human Urine Metabolome Cho et al. [84] studied the metabolomic changes in 14 healthy volunteers in response to single-dose metformin treatment (1000 mg). In particular, four metabolites, including cortisol, retinyl -glucuronide, betaine, and cholic acid glucuronide, were identi ed and quanti ed by LC-MS analysis in this study. Among them, cortisol and its metabolite hydroxycortisol were signi cantly decreased after metformin administration. According to Park et al. [85], the response to metformin in early-phase T2DM patients could be predicted by their urine metabolomic pro les acquired from GC-MS, which showed signi cantly different metabolites as markers of metformin response. In particular, citric acid and hippuric acid were higher and myoinositol was lower in the metformin responder group than the non-responder group. These results suggested that metabolic differences enabled them to discriminate between the metformin responder and non-responder groups ef ciently. 5. Cell and Tissue Metabolome and Metformin Treatment Global metabolomics analyses using body uid provide valuable results for the understanding and prediction of disease. Nevertheless, the mechanism of a disease or the drug response is often tissue- or cell-based and it is advantageous to analyze metabolomic

Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2021, 22, 10275 10 of 15 changes directly in the tissue or cells [86]. The cell is the basic structural, functional, and biological unit of all known organisms, and tissue is a cellular organizational level between cells and organisms. Therefore, the cell and tissue metabolome can be de ned as the set of all the metabolites present in them, and it is plausible that those metabolites are considered as the basic indicators of cell and tissue phenotypes [87]. Thus, metabolomics is a promising approach to explore those phenotypes and is useful in medical and life science research to understand the metabolism or mechanism of pathology or drug response. Cellbased study is widely used in disease research to investigate the molecular mechanism of the progression, response, and therapeutic resistance in disease status. Additionally, a cell-based approach is less expensive, and it is easier to control the environment and interpret the results, than analysis of animal models or human subjects. The comprehensive analysis of the metabolic alterations in the metabolite levels in cells can provide information as to the underlying causes of disease and targets for pharmacological intervention [35]. Initially, when the metabolic changes take place in response to a disease or drug response, tissue analyses are necessary. Unlike bio uids such as plasma and urine, cell and tissue metabolites are not diluted and enable us to provide stronger biomarkers [88]. The antineoplastic activity of metformin has been con rmed against several cancer types in vitro and in vivo [89]. However, the underlying mechanisms of metformin are not fully understood, and several studies have tried to apply metabolomics to explain the anticancer properties of metformin. According to Janzer et al. [90], biguanides including metformin and phenformin decrease TCA cycle intermediates including citrate, aconitate, isocitrate, alpha-ketoglutarate, fumarate, malate, and glutamate in cancer cell lines by using LC-MS. These results provided pharmacological and pathological evidence that mitochondrial complex I is a target of anticancer properties of biguanides. Soliman et al. [91] investigated the metabolic effect of metformin in the pancreatic cancer cell line using LC-MS, revealing the signi cant decrease in TCA cycle intermediates (citrate, isocitrate, and malate) which made a synergy with mTOR complex inhibition for reduced energy production. Zhang et al. [92] performed NMR-based metabolomic analysis of metformin-induced anticancer effects and demonstrated that metformin treatment could inhibit proliferations of human cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) cells, observing the remarkable decrease in glucose, fumarate, and alanine and increase in NAD+, UDP-GlcNAc, and BCAAs, implying the occurrence of autophagy and cell-cycle arrest. Liu et al. [93] carried out an LC-MS-based integrative metabolomics analysis of metformin action in ovarian cancer and observed the altered mitochondrial metabolism in human tumors from patients taking metformin with the suppression of TCA intermediates and short chain acyl carnitines. Those results consistently indicated that metformin affected the TCA cycle, which is the main energy production metabolism for cells. Yan et al. [94] performed integrative metabolomics analysis to systematically examine the effect of metformin on metabolic reprogramming, revealing the AMPK -independent metabolic alteration in mouse embryonic broblast (MEF) cells. Notably, metformin treatment signi cantly reduced the levels of citrate and succinate and elevated the cellular lactate level, which was evidence of TCA cycle suppression. Amino acid levels were also altered on the increase in serine, hypotaurine, and 3-methyl-2-oxovaleric acids and the decrease in proline, 3-guanidinobutyric acid, and aspartate. LV et al. [95] observed 28 metabolites in insulin-resistant cells by analyzing 1H NMR spectra and reported increased levels of valine, leucine, isoleucine, threonine, lactate, glutamate, glutamine, creatine, choline, glycine, and carnosine, and decreased level of aspartate, O-phosphocholine, taurine, ATP, and UDP-GlcNAc in metformin treatment. In detail, low metformin treatment recti ed glucose metabolic imbalance and regulated oxidative stress and phospholipid and energy metabolism. A high dose of metformin induced apoptosis and inhibited tumor cell growth through energy metabolism, phospholipid metabolism, and glucose catabolism. Riera-Borrull et al. [96] performed a targeted metabolomic study to investigate the protective effect of metformin against metabolic disturbances provoked by a high-fat diet (HFD) in a mice model by comparing the metabolic alteration on adipose tissue

Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2021, 22, 10275 11 of 15 and liver in response to metformin treatment. In white adipose tissue (WAT), metformin treatment led to a signi cant decrease in the levels of the BCAAs and increased glycolytic intermediates (phosphoenolpyruvate, pyruvate, and lactate) and TCA cycle intermediates. On the other hand, phosphoenolpyruvate levels signi cantly decreased in liver tissue. Hao et al. [97] investigated metabolism disturbances induced by corticosterone (CORT) and determined that metformin can reverse these effects. In their metabolomic approach, metformin treatment altered several metabolites involved in the pathway of the TCA cycle (isocitrate, citrate, alpha-ketoglutarate, oxaloacetate, malic acid, succinate, and fumarate) and the pathway of glycolysis and gluconeogenesis (3-phospho-D-glycerate, fructose 6phosphate, glucose 6-phosphate, and pyruvate) in liver tissue. CORT-induced depressionlike behaviors were also attenuated by metformin treatment. According to Li et al. [98], metformin improved locomotor function, but attenuated cognitive function in normoglycemic male mice. Brain metabolisms in normoglycemic mice are altered with the elevation of dimethylglycine, histidine, and choline and the reduction in malic acid, thymidine, dihydroxyacetone-phosphate (DHAP), and myo-inositol, revealing the inhibition of mitochondrial glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (mGPDH), reduced oxidative phosphorylation, and increased glycolysis. 6. Conclusions Metformin is widely studied for its therapeutic potentials as well as the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The metabolic pro les associated with various metabolisms and pathways were signi cantly in uenced by metformin treatment, regardless of metabolic condition, organism, or biospecimen, but the changes were not identical to each other. As shown in Figure 3, metformin treatment is associated with TCA cycle, urea cycle, glucose metabolism, lipid metabolism, or gut microbiota metabolism, but metabolic changes differed by organism, condition, and biospecimen. For example, the changes in BCAA levels were different in T2DM patients and animal models. Metabolomic research with metformin treatment rose in the early 2010s and has increased during the last 10 years, but the number of publications, especially based on clinical research, is still not enough to obtain robust results. Nevertheless, the observation of metabolic changes and the effort to explain those alterations are anticipated to be helpful to understand a mechanism of metformin and provide a better therapeutic usage of metformin.
