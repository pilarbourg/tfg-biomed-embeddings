ABSTRACT: The metabolism of L-tryptophan (TRP) regulates homeostasis, immunity, and neuronal function. 
Altered TRP metabolism has been implicated in the pathophysiology of various diseases of the central nervous 
system. TRP is metabolized through two main pathways, the kynurenine pathway and the methoxyindole 
pathway. First, TRP is metabolized to kynurenine, then kynurenic acid, quinolinic acid, anthranilic acid, 3-
hydroxykynurenine, and finally 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid along the kynurenine pathway. Second, TRP is 
metabolized to serotonin and melatonin along the methoxyindole pathway. In this review, we summarize the 
biological properties of key metabolites and their pathogenic functions in 12 disorders of the central nervous 
system: schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, spinal cord injury, traumatic brain injury, 
ischemic stroke, intracerebral hemorrhage, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, 
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and Huntington’s disease. Furthermore, we summarize preclinical and clinical 
studies, mainly since 2015, that investigated the metabolic pathway of TRP, focusing on changes in biomarkers 
of these neurologic disorders, their pathogenic implications, and potential therapeutic strategies targeting this 
metabolic pathway. This critical, comprehensive, and up-to-date review helps identify promising directions for 
future preclinical, clinical, and translational research on neuropsychiatric disorders.

1. Introduction 
 
L-tryptophan (TRP) is an essential amino acid that must 
be obtained from the diet. The TRP metabolites of the 
kynurenine pathway (KP) or the methoxyindole pathway 
(MP) are involved in the biosynthesis of proteins that are 
essential for neuronal construction and maintenance. 
These metabolites are significantly associated with the 
appearance, development, and outcomes of various 
neuropsychiatric disorders [1]. The metabolism of TRP by 
KP and MP is described in Figure 1. We first review 
changes in TRP metabolism and its pathogenic role in 
Volume 14, Number 3; 858-878, June 2023

psychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia (SCZ), 
bipolar disorder (BD), and major depressive disorder 
(MDD) [2], and in disorders of the central nervous system 
(CNS), such as spinal cord injury (SCI) [3], traumatic 
brain injury (TBI), ischemic stroke, and intracerebral 
hemorrhage (ICH) [4]. Next we review the role of TRP in 
multiple sclerosis (MS), an autoimmune disease [5], and 
neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease 
(AD), Parkinson’s disease (PD), amyotrophic lateral 
sclerosis (ALS), and Huntington’s disease (HD) [6]. We 
also review preclinical and clinical studies published 
mainly since 2015 that explore TRP metabolism, its 
downstream metabolic molecules, relevant biomarkers, 
and the potential therapeutic targets of this signaling 
pathway. This review is pivotal, comprehensive, and up 
to date and provides new ideas for exploring new 
treatment options and identifying promising directions for 
future research on drug discovery of neuropsychiatric 
disorders.

2. The KP 
 
TRP is absorbed from the intestinal tract and transported 
to the CNS via neutral amino acid transporters on the 
blood‒brain barrier (BBB) [7]. Under physiological 
conditions, more than 95% of free TRP is metabolized to 
kynurenine through the KP. In addition, a small portion is 
converted to serotonin and other metabolites [8]. The 
main branches of the KP are described in Figure 2. In KP, 
L-kynurenine (L-KYN), anthranilic acid (AA), 3-
hydroxykynurenine (3-HK), and kynurenic acid (KYNA) 
are formed in the brain and peripheral tissues. Peripheral 
kynurenine and other metabolites (excluding KYNA and 
3-hydroxyanthranilic acid (3-HAA)) are involved in 
central KP metabolism by passing through the BBB [9, 
10].

Figure 2. The main branches of the kynurenine pathway. TRP, L-KYN, and 3-HK can penetrate the BBB. Thus, they are 
converted to different intermediates in the extracellular space of brain tissue. TRP is converted to L-KYN by IDO1 in 
macrophages. L-KYN is converted to KYNA in astrocytes. 3-HK is converted to QUINA by HAAO in microglia. In diseases 
other than SCZ, KYNA is neuroprotective, as it can remove ROS and inhibit NMDARs, α7nAch, and AMPARs. QUIN is 
neurotoxic, as it can increase ROS formation, increase glutamate production, and activate NMDARs. Abbreviations: TRP, 
tryptophan; 3-HK, 3-hydroxykynurenine; HAAO, 3-hydroxyanthranilate 3,4-dioxygenase; α7nAChR: α7 nicotinic acetylcholine 
receptor; AMPAR: α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole-propionic acid receptor; BBB: blood‒brain barrier; IDO,

SCZ, schizophrenia; ROS, reactive oxygen species 
In KP, the first step is the conversion of TRP to N-
formyl kynurenine by indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 
(IDO1 or IDO2) and tryptophan-2,3-dioxygenase (TDO) 
and then to L-KYN. IDO1 is expressed, in addition to the 
brain, in many other organs, such as the kidney, pancreas, 
and white blood cells [11]. IDO1 plays a critical 
pathogenic role in brain disorders when activated by 
proinflammatory cytokines [12], such as interferon γ 
(IFN-γ), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and tumor necrosis factor α 
(TNF-α) [13]. This effect is more prominent in women 
than in men [14]. Dendritic cells also express IDO1 under 
physiological conditions but are highly induced by 
traumatic, autoimmune, and neuroinflammatory diseases 
[15-17]. IDO1 expression has been reported to be 
upregulated 6 h after injury and remains elevated for up to 
21 days in a controlled cortical impact model of pediatric 
TBI in rabbits [18]. Unlike IDO1, IDO2 is not active in 
TRP decomposition. Its physiological functions and roles 
in disease conditions involving KP activity are not yet 
clear [19]. However, Lauren M F Merlo et al. showed that 
IDO2 plays a proinflammatory role in mediating B and T-
cell activation in immune responses [20]. TDO is present 
mainly in the liver [21]. The peripheral system produces 
the majority of L-KYN (approximately 60%), but not all 
KYN metabolites are permeable to the brain. The rest is 
generated in the brain [22]. 
The KP pathway mainly produces two biologically 
active metabolites, quinolinic acid (QUINA) and KYNA. 
Kynurenine 3-monooxygenase (KMO) is predominantly 
expressed in microglia [23]. KMO converts KYN to 3-
HK, which is metabolized into the potential neurotoxin 
QUINA [24]. These two products antagonize each other 
and reach a balance. Neuroprotective L-KYN has 
immunosuppressive properties that inhibit antigen-
presenting cell (APC) activities, especially in dendritic 
cells 
[25]. 
Furthermore, 
L-KYN 
blocks

proliferation, upregulates programmed cell death-1, and 
leads to the generation of regulatory T cells [26]. 
Therefore, L-KYN exhibits neuroprotective and anti-
inflammatory properties by regulating innate and adaptive 
immunity. 
In 
a 
model 
of 
inflammation-induced 
depression, KYN increased at 2 h, and KYN 
concentrations decreased back to baseline levels at 6 h 
[27]. The concentration of QUINA in the cerebrospinal 
fluid of adult patients with TBI increases significantly in 
the first 72-83 h after injury, reaching approximately 9 
times the normal concentration of QUINA. KYN levels in 
cerebrospinal fluid from patients with severe TBI 
increases on Days 4 and 5 after injury, KYNA increases 
on Days 2-5 after injury, and QUINA increases on Days 
1-5 after injury [24]. Zakhary G et al. found that the 
expression of QUINA and KYNA increased at 24 and 72 
h after partial frontal lobectomy in rats [28]. 
Three branches are involved in the metabolism of 
kynurenine: (1) the KYNA pathway, (2) the AA pathway, 
and (3) the 3-HK pathway. Next, 3-HK is converted to 3-
HAA, which merges with the second metabolic pathway. 
Finally, 3-HAA can be converted to QUINA and 
eventually nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) or 
picolinic acid (PA) [19]. The primary metabolites in the 
TRP pathway are described in Table 1.

The three branches ultimately generate two 
metabolites: KYNA and QUINA [29]. However, acute 
injuries or chronic neuroinflammation disrupt this 
equilibrium and cause neurotoxic metabolites to 
predominate. These toxic metabolites can damage the 
CNS and cause neurodegeneration. In contrast to previous 
research, recent studies have shown that KYNA might 
exert both neuroprotective and neurotoxic effects [19]. 
(1) L-KYN generates KYNA by kynurenine amino-
transferase (KAT). KAT enzymes are believed to be 
expressed in brain astrocytes. KYNA inhibits endogenous 
broad-spectrum glutamate receptors, namely, N-methyl-
D-aspartic acid receptors (NMDAR), kainite receptors, 
and α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole-propionic 
acid receptors (AMPAR) [30]. The most significant effect 
is an inhibition of the NMDAR glycine binding site at 
high micromolar concentrations [31]. KYNA is also a 
partial antagonist of the ionic glutamate receptor and the 
kainite receptor, inhibiting the effect of glutamate at high 
concentrations 
[30]. 
Significantly, 
nanomolar 
to 
micromolar levels of KYNA can facilitate AMPA 
receptor responses [32]. Furthermore, KYNA can 
function as a noncompetitive antagonist of the α7 
nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (α7nAchR) [33]. It 
interferes with glutamate and nicotinic neurotransmission, 
reducing glutamate levels in neuronal synapses and thus 
preventing excessive glutamate excitement. Excess 
glutamate in the synaptic cleft dysregulates Ca2+ 
homeostasis, mitochondrial function, and reactive oxygen 
species (ROS) production [5]. KYNA also stimulates G 
protein coupled receptor (GPR) 35, which is expressed on 
the surface of various immune cells and exhibits an anti-
inflammatory effect [34]. For example, the KYNA-
GPR35 interaction can reduce the inflammatory response 
of mononuclear macrophages to lipopolysaccharide [35] 
and release cytokines from human invariant natural killer 
cells [36]. Similarly, KYNA activates the aryl 
hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), which may exert an 
immunosuppressive effect similar to that of KYN [37]. 
One recent study demonstrated that KYNA removes ROS 
as an antioxidant [31]. This data indicate that KYNA 
protects against neurotoxicity by inhibiting NMDAR. In 
addition, KYNA antagonism to NMDA and α7nAch 
exacerbates cognitive dysfunction in SCZ [38].  
(2) L-KYN is degraded by kynurenase to produce 
AA, which is further converted to 3-HAA by 
monohydroxylase. Serum AA levels may indicate the 
severity of depression, and brain AA concentrations are 
significantly associated with the appearance of depression 
during the treatment of patients with hepatitis C [9]. 
(3) L-KYN can be catalyzed by KMO to 3-HK and 
then converted to 3-HAA by KYNU, therefore merging 
with the second metabolic branch. A series of enzymes, 
such as 3-hydroxyanthranilate oxidase, metabolize 3-
HAA to QUINA and ultimately to NAD+ or PA. In 
addition, 3-HK can be converted to xanthurenic acid (XA) 
by KAT. Finally, 3-HAA is oxidized to generate 
cinnabarinic acid (CA). 
KMO is expressed in resident macrophages in 
adipose tissue [39] and predominantly in microglia [40] 
but not in neurons or astrocytes in the brain [41, 42] In 
TBI or neurodegenerative conditions, the main rate-
limiting enzyme in neurotoxicity, KMO, is activated by 
proinflammatory factors in microglia to generate 
neurotoxic products such as 3-HK, 3-HAA, and QUINA 
[12]. Therefore, KMO is considered a promising target for 
anti-inflammatory therapy to treat neuroinflammation, but 
modulation of the dual role of KMO remains to be studied. 
3-HK is a product of L-KYN transformed through 
KMO, which has strong lipophilicity and can easily pass 
through the BBB [43]. 3-HK autoxidation converts it to 3-
HAA and participates in fat peroxidation and other 
oxidative stress processes [22]. 
QUINA can mediate neural excitotoxicity by 
promoting glutamate production and inhibiting the uptake 
and conversion of glutamate into glutamine [44]. 
However, QUINA can also selectively activate NMDARs 
[8]. This effect is more pronounced in the hippocampus, 
neocortex, and striatum but not in the cerebellum or spinal 
cord neurons. Neurons in the former locations 
predominantly express the NR2B subunit of NMDAR, 
while neurons in the latter brain areas mainly contain the 
NR2C subunits, and QUINA has a higher affinity for the 
NR2B subunits [45]. In addition, QUINA can combine 
with iron to transfer electrons to oxygen to form ROS, 
which leads to lipid peroxidation [29]. This suggests the 
use of iron chelation to inhibit the binding of QUINA to 
iron and thus protect neurons [46]. QUINA also affects 
GFAP phosphorylation and decreases the stability of the 
astrocyte 
cytoskeleton, 
thus 
contributing 
to 
the 
breakdown of the BBB [47]. 
Furthermore, by activating NMDARs, QUINA 
induces astrocyte apoptosis and neuronal dysfunction 
[47]. QUINA also increases the expression of nitric oxide 
synthase and thus influences the production of nitric oxide 
(NO•) as well as vasodilation [48]. The effects of QUINA 
and KYNA show a certain degree of antagonism, 
suggesting that the balance of these two metabolites may 
affect the development and prognosis of various 
neurological diseases. Furthermore, QUINA generates 
NAD+ under physiological conditions (< 100 nm). It is 
also involved in energy metabolism within mitochondria 
[47]. The imbalance in the NAD+/NADH ratio is 
associated with mitochondrial disorders and aging and 
age-related diseases [3]. 
CA and XA act on metabotropic glutamate receptors 
(mGlu) [30]. CA can inhibit excitotoxic neuronal cell 
death by activating mGlu4 receptors, while XA has

                                                                      Tryptophan metabolism in CNS diseases 
 
Aging and Disease • Volume 14, Number 3, June 2023                                                                              863 
 
antipsychotic-like effects by positively activating mGlu2 
and mGlu3 receptors [49]. In addition, CA can serve as an 
AhR ligand to stimulate T cells to produce IL-22[50]. 
Changes caused by the combination of CA and AhR are 
not yet known. Xanthine may exhibit a neuroprotective 
effect by reducing 3-OH-kynurenine levels. It also 
induces cell apoptosis by altering mitochondrial function 
and increasing the concentration of intracellular calcium 
ions, thus playing an excitatory role in the brain [51]. 
Under physiological conditions, PA is rarely present in the 
brain, replacing NAD+ when enzymes such as 3-
hydroxyanthranilate oxidases are present [34]. As a 
secondary signal for macrophages, PA causes the 
activation of IFN-γ-primed macrophages and triggers a 
cytokine-driven inflammatory response [52]. 
 
3. The MP 
 
Another metabolic direction of TRP is through the MP. 
First, tryptophan-5-hydroxylase metabolizes TRP to 5-
hydroxy tryptophan (5-HT). It is then converted to 
serotonin by the aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase 
enzyme. Next, serotonin forms N-acetyl serotonin (NAS), 
also an agonist of BDNF receptors [53], and melatonin, 
by an alkylamine N-acetyltransferase. 
Melatonin is neuroprotective against glutamate 
toxicity [54]. Previous studies have shown multiple anti-
inflammatory effects, including inhibition of the 
expression of neuronal NO synthase and cyclooxygenase-
2, reducing the BOX-1 signal of the high-mobility group 
and activating Toll-like receptor-4, negatively regulating 
NLRP3, inhibiting the activation of NF-κB, and positively 
regulating nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 [55]. 
Melatonin penetrates the BBB [56] and thus binds to G 
protein-coupled receptors after secretion, namely, MT1 
and MT2 [57]. As an antioxidant, it directly scavenges 
free radicals and indirectly stimulates antioxidant 
enzymes to inhibit oxidative enzymes and stabilize 
mitochondrial membranes [58, 59]. Furthermore, the 
cascade reaction products of melatonin have antioxidant 
properties. 
N(1)-acetyl-5-methoxykynuramine, 
for 
example, has an efficient antioxidant effect [60]. In the 
Fenton/Haber-Weiss reaction, melatonin chelates ferrous 
iron and copper, reducing toxic hydroxyl radicals and 
oxidative stress [61]. Melatonin is said to be an efficient 
antioxidant and protects against metal-induced oxidative 
stress; it also exhibits significant antineuroinflammatory 
properties and can protect against AD [62]. Melatonin has 
been investigated in several clinical trials for its 
antioxidant, 
anti-inflammatory, 
and 
antiapoptotic 
properties and the restoration of tissue function, with 
consistent protective effects observed [61]. 
 
 
4. Psychiatric disorders 
 
4.1. SCZ 
 
The pathophysiology of SCZ supports the hypothesis of 
hypofunction of NMDARs, which could be associated 
with metabolites of the KYN pathway that suppress 
NMDARs [30] and therefore decrease neurotransmitter 
activities. As an antagonist of NMDARs, KYNA plays a 
vital role in this process [38]. The KYN pathway plays 
various roles in the dysregulation of the SCZ immune 
system. Through a meta-analysis, Cao Bing et al. reported 
lower levels of TRP and higher KYN/TRP ratios in SCZ 
patients; lower KYN was associated with SCZ patients 
without medication, while higher levels of KYN were 
observed in patients after treatment [63]. Abbas F. 
Almulla et al. showed an increase in IDO activity in brain 
tissue and peripheral serum and a decrease in KMO 
activity and a reduction in KYNA production in the brains 
of SCZ patients [64]. Impaired KMO expression and 
activity were also observed in postmortem brain tissues of 
SCZ patients [65]. Subsequent elevation of KYNA levels 
was suggested to have a causal link with the 
psychopathology of SCZ, as in the so-called "KYNA 
hypothesis of SCZ" [66]. Elevated levels of KYNA in 
developing brain tissue or CSF [67] are related to 
cognitive deficits [68] and psychotic symptoms [69] in 
SCZ. The single nucleotide polymorphism of the KMO 
gene is related to SCZ, further supporting the notion that 
the decrease in the 3-HK branch in the KP pathway may 
cause L-KYN to convert to KYNA, which is one of the 
causes of SCZ [19]. 
In addition to KYNA, the newly discovered 3-HK 
metabolite XA may play a pathogenic role in SCZ. As an 
endogenous agonist of the mGlu2 receptor, XA exhibits 
antipsychotic 
therapeutic 
effects 
in 
mice 
[70]. 
Interestingly, blood levels of XA are markedly reduced in 
patients affected by SCZ, regardless of the stage of the 
disorder or drug status, suggesting that lower levels of XA 
in blood may serve as a potential trait marker for SCZ 
[70]. Another KYNA metabolite is CA, an activator of 
metabotropic glutamate receptors mGlu4, which may 
have a therapeutic role in SCZ. However, CA did not 
confer any therapeutic effects in mice with mGlu4 
deficiency [71]. Furthermore, CA levels were low in brain 
tissues from SCZ patients [71]. In particular, circulating 
AA levels are elevated in SCZ patients simultaneously 
with KYNA [70, 72] and are positively correlated with the 
severity of symptoms [10]. 
 
4.2. BD 
 
BD is a mental illness characterized by abnormalities in 
the structure and function of several areas of the brain 

 Huang Y., et al.  
                                                                      Tryptophan metabolism in CNS diseases 
 
Aging and Disease • Volume 14, Number 3, June 2023                                                                              864 
 
(e.g., the prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, 
amygdala, and hippocampus) [73]. Although the 
pathomechanism of BD is not clearly understood, there is 
a wide range of evidence that inflammation and TRP 
metabolism contribute to the development of the disease 
[74]. The sorting nexin family is involved in the 
regulation 
of 
intracellular 
transport 
and 
signal 
transmission. A postmortem study of the brains of BD 
patients revealed that downregulation of sorting nexin 7 
increased caspase-8-driven interleukin-1β production, 
subsequently activating the KYN pathway and resulting 
in neurotoxicity [75]. Another MRI study showed that the 
L-KYN/TRP (K/T) ratio in the blood of patients with BD 
was negatively correlated with amygdala volume, corpus 
callosum integrity, and frontal-parietal cortex thickness as 
quantified by MRI [76]. KYNA is considered protective 
in BD, but in patients with lifelong psychotic 
characteristics, elevated KYNA levels in the CSF are 
correlated with genetic mutations in KMO [77]. 
Therefore, the accumulation of KYNA in the brain is 
related to the pathophysiology of BD. Changes in 
melatonin secretion are also correlated with the disease 
state. Patients with BD with altered circadian rhythms had 
reduced levels of melatonin during the euphoric, manic, 
and depressive phases [78]. There is evidence that the 
level of 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5HIAA), the main 
serotonin metabolite, is reduced in the cortex of patients 
with BD. Decreases in central 5-HT activity in patients 
with BD might cause mania and depression [79]. 
 
4.3. MDD 
 
MDD is related to elevated metabolism in the 3-HK 
branch of the KP. The process of enhanced degradation of 
TRP to KYN away from serotonin production is called a 
"KYN shunt". The TRP degradation pathway and the 
KYN shunt have been implicated in MDD [80]. The 
shutdown of TRP metabolism from the MP to KP, moving 
away from serotonin production to KYN production, 
leads to serotonin deficiency in MDD [81]. It also results 
in higher levels of the neurotoxic metabolite QUINA than 
the neuroprotective metabolite KYNA [23]. KP activation 
has been clinically observed in interferon-induced 
depression, and LPS-induced depression-like behavior in 
animals has been associated with activation of the KYN 
pathway [80]. A clinical study showed that the ratio of 
KYNA to 3HK or QUINA is positively associated with 
hippocampal volume, and decreased hippocampal volume 
is correlated with impaired autobiographical memory 
recall in patients with MDD [23]. The levels of L-KYN, 
3-HK, and KYNA are elevated in the mouse model of 
chronic social defeat [82]. The body produces PA to limit 
the formation of quinoline and inhibit suicidal behavior 
[82]. Changes in IDO-1 expression were analyzed in 
MDD patients, with higher baseline levels observed in 
patients than in normal controls, and the clinical efficacy 
of the antidepressant can be attributed at least partly to 
decreases in IDO1 expression. However, there are 
currently no reports on IDO2 expression in MDD [83]. 
Increased levels of IDO1 can lead to increased 3-HK 
production, which exerts a neurotoxic effect. The 
polymorphism of the IDO1 gene is related to 
susceptibility to cytokine-induced depression [84]. 
Consistent with our expectations, IDO knockout mice 
exhibit reduced depression-like behavior [85]. 
TNF, IL-6, and other inflammatory genes in peripheral 
blood mononuclear cells are upregulated in patients with 
MDD. The expression level of these genes is associated 
with the amygdala response to fear [82]. For a long time, 
evidence has linked 5-HT to the etiology of MDD. The 
classic antidepressant drugs, selective serotonin reuptake 
inhibitors (SSRIs), including sertraline and fluoxetine, 
exert their effects by increasing serotonin levels in the 
synaptic cleft [86]. Furthermore, previous studies have 
shown TRP depletion in the brains of MDD patients with 
decreased availability of the serotonin-1A receptor and 
the -2A receptor [87]. However, serotonin levels are 
increased in multiple depressive phenotypes, indicating 
the involvement of other mechanisms in MDD [88]. 
 
4.4. Therapeutic Perspectives 
 
Targeting the TRP mechanism is an ongoing research 
direction to treat the psychiatric disorders mentioned 
above. Long-term SCZ could be controlled by blocking 
KYN transport to the brain or inhibiting KYNA 
production in the brain [19]. For example, for the 
treatment of SCZ, the enzyme KATII is one of the targets. 
The KATII inhibitor (S)-4-(ethylsulfonyl) benzoylalanine 
(S-ESBA) has been shown to reduce KYNA levels in the 
rat brain and thus enhance cognition [89]. However, the 
selective difference between species and the toxicity of 
KAT inhibitors limits their potential use [19]. Given that 
XA production also depends on KAT, it remains unclear 
whether inhibiting KAT is a worthwhile treatment option. 
A new direction in BD therapy is the modulation of 
biological rhythms. As an agonist of MT1 and MT2, 
agomelatine has been shown in clinical trials to be 
beneficial for 81% of patients with bipolar I disorder. 
However, it has side effects, such as mania, when 
combined with lithium, and other studies have shown that 
it has no apparent therapeutic effect [90]. Elevating 
endogenous melatonin levels in the brains of patients with 
BD is a feasible solution. Reducing KP while increasing 
MP may be a promising treatment prospect, such as 
inhibiting IDO1 with subsequent decreases in neurotoxic 
products. For MDD patients, two feasible treatment 
options include the use of KYNA competitive inhibitors, 

 Huang Y., et al.  
                                                                      Tryptophan metabolism in CNS diseases 
 
Aging and Disease • Volume 14, Number 3, June 2023                                                                              865 
 
such as AV-101, and inhibiting transport of L-KYN to the 
brain. For example, leucine can compete with L-KYN for 
LAT1, thus reducing the concentration of KYNA in the 
brain [8]. Furthermore, previous studies have shown that 
10 of the 19 amino acids can reduce L-KYN synthesis 
[91], suggesting that diet therapy can help in the 
management 
of 
mental 
illness. 
The 
specific 
pathophysiology that underlies psychiatric disorders 
remains unclear. Compounds targeting KP hold promise 
as novel treatments. Well-designed preclinical and 
clinical studies with KP-targeted treatment are needed to 
advance our understanding and the treatment of 
psychiatric disorders. 
 
5. Acute spinal cord and brain injury 
 
5.1. SCI 
 
SCI damages the spinal cord and results in spinal cord 
shock. After an initial mechanical injury, damaged cells 
release neurotoxic glutamate [92]. Glutamate acts on the 
glutamate receptor AMPA, causing the death of 
oligodendrocytes and demyelinating nerve cells. KYNA 
exhibits a neuroprotective effect due to its inhibition of 
glutamate release, while QUINA exerts the opposite 
effect [93]. Previous studies have also shown that an 
increase in QUINA levels after SCI is related to suicidal 
ideation. Administration of inhibitors to reduce the 
production of QUINA without affecting the levels of other 
neuroactive substances can significantly increase the area 
of white matter that survives within the injured site. 
Administration of KYNA derivatives can improve 
recovery of motor function in adult male Wistar rats 1-4 
weeks after SCI [93]. Furthermore, 5-HT promotes the 
regeneration of damaged axons [93]. 
 
5.2. TBI 
 
A TBI is caused by an external force that injures the brain. 
Its pathogenesis involves primary and secondary injury. 
Inflammation leads to secondary brain damage and 
promotes ROS formation [94, 95]. The generation of 
inflammatory cytokines, such as IFN-γ and IL-6, 
increases the expression level of IDO. Elevated levels of 
IDO and QUINA are present in young rabbit models of 
TBI [18]. In human TBI, it has been confirmed that 
QUINA, L-KYN, and KYNA levels increase in the CSF. 
The concentration of QUINA and IDO1 expression is 
correlated with the worsening condition and mortality of 
a patient, suggesting the harmful effects of KP [15]. Acute 
early activation of the KYNA pathway can prevent the 
development of depressive symptoms after mild TBI, and 
QUINA in serum can potentially be a biomarker of 
repetitive TBI [96]. Targeting TRP metabolism can help 
to elucidate its pathogenic role in various emotional 
changes induced by TBI [97]. 
 
5.3. Ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke 
 
Stroke can be classified as ischemic or hemorrhagic 
stroke. Ischemic stroke is caused by thrombotic or 
embolic occlusion of a cerebral artery. In contrast, 
hemorrhagic stroke (e.g., ICH) refers to the accumulation 
of intracerebral bleeding caused by the rupture of a 
penetrating artery. The pathogenesis of ischemic or 
hemorrhagic stroke can be divided into primary and 
secondary brain injury. Direct damage to ischemic stroke 
is due to the initial interruption of cerebral blood flow, 
causing a local brain infarction. The primary injury to ICH 
is due to increased intracranial pressure caused by 
physical compression of a hematoma. Secondary brain 
injury caused by ischemic stroke or ICH involves 
excitotoxicity, inflammation, and oxidative stress [98-
100]. Excitotoxicity induced by TRP metabolites could be 
one of the mechanisms of the secondary injury. Animal 
experiments show that the QUINA/KYNA ratio increases 
in mice and gerbils, which is related to immune cell 
infiltration and the severity of ischemic stroke [101]. One 
study showed that IDO activity increases in ischemic 
stroke and correlates with prognosis; simultaneously, 
TRP levels decreased, suggesting that TRP metabolism 
improved [102]. The 3-HAA/AA ratio decreases when the 
KYNA level increases, indicating a compensatory 
protection mechanism against secondary brain damage 
[103]. Serum melatonin concentration decreases after 
stroke. As a neuroprotective agent, melatonin improves 
prognosis when administered exogenously [104]. ICH is 
a common and serious cerebrovascular disease with high 
mortality [105]. Similar to ischemic stroke, TRP 
metabolism may play a role in the pathophysiology of 
ICH. However, very few studies have investigated the 
effects of TRP metabolism in preclinical and clinical ICH 
studies [106], indicating a new direction of research. 
 
5.4. Therapeutic Perspectives 
 
Modulation of KP production is significant in the 
treatment of traumatic disorders, and KMO may be a new 
pharmacological target for the treatment of traumatic 
disorders [107]. Furthermore, KMO inhibitors can reduce 
the impact of chronic inflammation and potentially 
mitigate neuropathic pain and psychological disturbances 
after SCI [93]. TDO and KMO inhibitors also improve the 
prognosis of stroke patients, while IDO inhibitors do not 
show protection [103]. 
In preclinical studies, the NMDAR inhibitor 
memantine has improved the prognosis of ischemic stroke 
[108]. Furthermore, as an endogenous ligand for 

 Huang Y., et al.  
                                                                      Tryptophan metabolism in CNS diseases 
 
Aging and Disease • Volume 14, Number 3, June 2023                                                                              866 
 
NMDAR, KYNA is a promising drug candidate with 
fewer CNS side effects. For example, N-(2-N,N-
dimethylaminoethyl)-4-oxo-1H-quinoline-2-
carboxamide hydrochloride, a KYNA analog, has shown 
therapeutic efficacy [109]. 
5-HT and melatonin are also drug candidates for 
drugs for traumatic disorders. Potential treatment 
strategies 
for 
SCI 
include 
the 
regulation 
of 
neuroinflammation 
and 
the 
transplantation 
of 
mesenchymal stem cells and neural precursors to create a 
preregeneration 
environment 
and 
increase 
the 
preregeneration capacity of damaged neurons. 5-HT can 
promote the regeneration of damaged axons. Increased 5-
HT axon density at the injured site is a good indicator of 
improved functional recovery [110]. Furthermore, 
melatonin reduces oxidative stress and inflammation by 
activating the signaling pathway of nuclear factor 
erythroid 2-related factor 2 and alleviates secondary 
damage to TBI [94]. Oral melatonin can reduce the 
severity of stroke patients and improve cognitive decline 
[104]. 
 
6. Autoimmune diseases 
 
6.1. MS 
 
MS is an autoimmune-mediated disorder characterized by 
the formation of sclerotic plaques, inflammation, and 
demyelination [111]. There is an apparent KP imbalance 
in MS, although the exact role of KP is not fully clear. 
Preclinical studies have shown that IDO1 activity 
decreases in the brain and spinal cord of mice with 
experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), 
leading to increased Th1 and Th17-cell activity and 
reduced Treg cell activity, worsening the severity of the 
disease [112, 113]. Another study showed that after 
increasing IDO1 activity, 3-HAA in KP increased, 
resulting in an immunosuppressive effect [114]. 
Furthermore, the results of an in vitro study indicated that 
QUINA can alter oligodendrocytes, thus expanding its 
pathogenic effects in MS [22]. 
Clinical trials have shown that enhancing IDO1 
suppresses immune responses, suggesting that IDO1 
exerts anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects [44]. 
The CSF level of TRP decreases in MS patients [22]. The 
accumulation of QUINA is related to the severity of the 
disease [111]. The level of KYNA in the CSF of MS 
patients is significantly reduced in remission. In contrast, 
KYNA levels in plasma and CSF increase during acute 
relapse and decrease during chronic remission [22]. These 
findings indicate that KYNA may be involved in the 
relapse-remission phase of the disease. In the CSF, the PA 
level decreases while the QUINA level increases, which 
implies that KP metabolism switches to the neurotoxic 
pathway [111]. 5-HT may play a pathogenic role in MS as 
its expression level in the CSF is decreased in MS patients 
[115]. NAS, the 5-HT metabolite, interacts directly with 
IDO1 and functions as a positive allosteric modulator to 
elevate the level of L-KYN [116]. It also activates AhR, 
thus exerting anti-inflammatory and immunoregulatory 
effects [116]. 
 
6.2. Therapeutic Perspectives 
 
In summary, TRP metabolites and enzymes play a 
significant role in the pathogenesis of MS. The data 
suggest that by regulating the production or activity of 
these enzymes or metabolites or using synthetic analogs, 
MS can be managed or treated. Previous studies suggest 
that increasing IDO activity and inhibiting the production 
of downstream catabolic products hinder the progression 
of EAE and may be a new therapeutic strategy [117]. The 
KYNA analog laquinimod has been used as a disease-
modifying therapy to treat MS in multiple stages [118]. In 
addition to anti-inflammatory and immune regulation, 
laquinimod protects astrocytes and oligodendrocytes 
[119]. It also reduces axon damage and promotes 
remyelination [120]. However, due to its severe adverse 
effects, it cannot be used currently as a drug in clinical 
practice [120]. Therefore, more studies are needed to 
investigate drug candidates with better and superior 
curative effects with fewer side effects [44]. 
Increasing the level of 5-HT can provide therapeutic 
benefits. Phenelzine can increase the content of 5-HT 
between axons and has also been shown to improve 
behavioral performance in a mouse model of EAE [121]. 
However, clinical trials have shown that fluoxetine, 
another drug that can increase the 5-HT concentration in 
the brain, did not benefit MS patients significantly [122]. 
The reason may be the small sample size, the baseline 
imbalance, or confounding bias [115]. These two 
contrasting results suggest that alternative mechanisms 
that regulate 5-HT may need to be investigated. 
 
7. Neurodegeneration 
 
7.1. AD 
 
AD is the most common form of dementia, with 
continuous cognitive impairment and progressive 
memory loss [123]. Deposition of misfolded proteins such 
as amyloid beta-protein (Aβ) and hyperphosphorylated 
tau, loss of synaptic transmission, and neuroinflammation 
are characteristics of AD [124]. Tryptophan metabolites, 
QUINA and KYNA, together with other intermediates, 
show elevated concentrations associated with Aβ and tau 
in the CSF of AD patients, which are neurodegeneration 
biomarkers, suggesting that TRP is closely related to the 

 Huang Y., et al.  
                                                                      Tryptophan metabolism in CNS diseases 
 
Aging and Disease • Volume 14, Number 3, June 2023                                                                              867 
 
core pathology of AD [125]. One study showed that CSF 
levels of Aβ40 and Aβ42 correlated with those of K/T, 
KYNA, L-KYN, QUINA, and AA in AD patients with a 
high neocortical Aβ load [125]. Furthermore, high levels 
of QUINA are associated with neuronal damage in AD 
[126]. An increased K/T ratio in serum and CSF indicates 
that TRP metabolism is enhanced, and IDO activation 
increases in AD [5]. 
KYNA activation increases NAD+ production, 
promotes DNA repair, strengthens genomic signaling, and 
generates more energy [127]. Therefore, it plays an 
important role in antioxidant defense and protection 
against AD [128]. Neurotoxic QUINA, mainly produced 
by activated microglia, can induce tau phosphorylation 
[129]. 
Interestingly, 
IDO-1 
is 
colocalized 
with 
extracellular Aβ plaques [130]. KYNA levels are elevated 
in the CSF [131] but decreased in serum [132]. A recent 
study demonstrated that 3-HK and 3-HAA increase Cu++-
induced neurotoxicity in rat astrocyte cultures [133]. 
However, the mechanism behind the neuronal death 
induced by TRP metabolites is not fully understood. 
Melatonin is a branch of TRP metabolism. As an 
antioxidant, free radical scavenger, protein aggregation 
inhibitor, anti-inflammatory agent, and regulator of 
various enzymes, melatonin exerts a neuroprotective role 
in delaying the development of AD [134]. The available 
evidence suggests that TRP metabolism is involved in the 
pathogenesis 
of 
AD. 
Therefore, 
targeting 
TRP 
metabolism will help to elucidate the pathomechanism of 
AD. 
 
7.2. PD 
 
PD is another common age-related neurodegenerative 
disease. Degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the 
substantia nigra pars compacta produces characteristic 
motor symptoms [5]. Alpha-synuclein and dopamine 
metabolites in the CSF are considered biomarkers of PD 
[135]. Serum levels of TRP, L-KYN, and KYNA are 
lower in PD patients than in controls [136]. The KP of 
TRP 
catabolism 
can 
regulate 
inflammatory 
and 
neurotoxic processes in PD. The K/T ratio and 3-HK 
levels in the putamen, frontal cortex, and hippocampus of 
PD patients is significantly increased, indicating an 
increase in IDO/TDO activity in PD patients [137]. The 
KYNA level is decreased in the striatum and CSF of 
patients with PD and correlated with an increase in 
excitotoxicity, while the QUINA level is increased in the 
striatum and cortex [138]. QUINA and 3-HK are involved 
in the pathogenesis of PD. Related underlying 
mechanisms 
include 
NMDAR 
activation, 
ROS 
production [139], lipid peroxidation, and increased levels 
of nitric oxide synthase [136]. There is a significant 
correlation between increased neopterin levels and the 
K/T ratio in the serum and CSF of patients with PD [137], 
with high cell-mediated immunity (e.g., CD4+ T cells and 
CD8+ T cells) in patients with advanced PD. 
 
7.3. ALS 
 
ALS is a progressive neurodegenerative disease 
characterized by selective death of motor neurons in the 
cerebral cortex, brainstem, and spinal cord, leading to 
atrophy of voluntary muscles, weakness, paralysis, and 
premature death [140]. In the brain, the level of TRP 
regulates serotonin production. Depression is related to 
decreased serotonin levels caused by TRP depletion [141] 
and sleep disturbances caused by decreased melatonin, 
both of which are symptoms in patients with ALS. The 
most commonly measured KPMs are L-KYN, TRP, 
KYNA, XA, and AA, and their levels are stable in ALS 
[142]. Astrocytosis is a feature of neuroinflammation in 
ALS. Activated microglia and activated KP are present in 
the motor cortex of patients with ALS, and the levels of 
TRP, L-KYN and QUINA in the CSF and serum are 
increased [143]. When the disease worsens, the high 
KYNA level is proportional to the severity and is 
neuroprotective. One study showed no significant 
differences in KYNA levels in serum or CSF between 
patients and control subjects [142]. However, the level of 
KYNA in CSF was higher in patients with severe clinical 
conditions than in control subjects, and the KYNA 
concentrations in serum and CSF are not related [142]. 
CSF levels of QUINA and IDO increased significantly in 
patients with ALS [6]. Activated voluminous microglia, 
reactive astrocytes, infiltrating macrophages, and T cells 
are present in the brain and spinal cord of ALS patients, 
suggesting that these inflammatory cells play a role in the 
pathogenesis of ALS [144], particularly glutamate 
excitotoxicity, oxidative stress, mitochondrial metabolic 
dysfunction, neuroinflammation, protein aggregation, and 
autophagy [144]. These data suggest that QUINA 
contributes to the pathophysiology of ALS. 
 
7.4. HD 
 
HD is an autosomal dominant neurogenetic disorder. Its 
pathogenesis involves the repeat expansion of CAG in the 
first exon of the huntingtin gene (HTT), which encodes a 
polyglutamine stretch in the HTT protein [145]. 
Preclinical studies have shown that melatonin is 
significantly increased in presymptomatic HD sheep 
[146], and a self-protective response to the toxicity of the 
mutant huntingtin protein could be the cause [146]. 
Experiments with human samples and animal genetic 
models of HD have demonstrated that neuroactive 
metabolites in KP play a role in the development of HD 
[147]. Clinical studies have shown that the level of 3-HK 

 Huang Y., et al.  
                                                                      Tryptophan metabolism in CNS diseases 
 
Aging and Disease • Volume 14, Number 3, June 2023                                                                              868 
 
increases in the brains of patients [148], which has a toxic 
effect on the striatum, thus increasing the production of 
toxic QUINA. Increased QUINA causes a certain degree 
of excitotoxicity or oxidative stress, leading to striatal 
neuronal dysfunction [6]. A clinical study showed that the 
K/T ratio in the CSF is higher in HD patients than in 
control subjects at baseline and after TRP depletion, 
which can be caused by eating an amino acid mixture 
containing all essential amino acids except TRP [149]. 
The results suggested an increase in IDO activity in the 
HD brain. 
Furthermore, HD patients exhibit abnormal TRP 
metabolism and increased oxidative stress. These factors 
contribute to continued brain dysfunction. Plasma levels 
of KYNA, 3-HK, and 3-HAA and KAT activity are 
decreased in HD [149]. Inhibition of KMO activity 
reduces QUINA production in HD brain tissues [77], 
suggesting that the KP inhibitor can reduce huntingtin-
induced abnormal cytotoxicity.

7.5. Therapeutic Perspectives 
 
In general, inhibitors of the key enzymes in KP are 
believed to be therapeutic candidates for neuro-
degenerative diseases. KMO is located at the point of 
branch of QUINA and KYNA production. Therefore, 
drugs that specifically inhibit KMO activity, such as JM6 
and Ro61-8048, can change metabolism to increase 
KYNA levels and reduce extracellular glutamate in the 
brain, providing neuroprotection [150]. Metabolites of the 
KP of TRP degradation, such as QUINA, induce cerebral 
oxidative stress and trigger the inflammatory response in 
several neurodegenerative diseases. As a phytochemical 
with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities, 
phenolic compounds can treat neurodegenerative diseases 
[151]. With similar biological properties, melatonin could 
also be a candidate drug [134]. 
Targeting TRP metabolism can help in the 
development of disease-modifying therapies for AD. The 
serotonin receptor (a G protein-coupled receptor) 5-HT4 
and 5-HT6 receptors are new potential drug targets [152]. 
One of the main effects of 5-HT6R activation is to reduce 
cholinergic transmission. Therefore, receptor antagonists 
can increase ACh production and stimulate cholinergic 
transmission. KYNA functions on the Ach receptor as a 
noncompetitive antagonist since the Ach concentration is 
decreased in AD [33]. The drugs available today exert 
only a symptomatic effect. Therefore, acetylcholine-
sterase and butyrylcholinesterase inhibitors remain FDA-
approved drugs for the treatment of AD [153], including 
rivastigmine and galantamine [154]. TRP metabolites 
have tremendous therapeutic potential in AD, KYNA, and 
5-HIAA and can reduce the accumulation of Aβ in the 
brain [155]. Exploring 5-HIAA analogs or precursors 
using KMO combined with KYNA may become a new 
research direction. 
Although dopaminergic agonists (e.g., ropinirole, 
pramipexole, rotigotine), L-DOPA, and carbidopa are 
widely used to treat PD, they provide symptomatic relief 
but not a cure. Furthermore, the pathomechanism of the 
progression of metabolite-mediated disease of these drugs 
remains elusive [156]. However, inhibition of KMOs such 
as Ro 61-8048 can increase KYNA levels in PD brain 
tissue [157], which could be a potential drug candidate for

the treatment of PD [156]. Treatment targeting TRP 
includes probenecid, L-KYN + probenecid, and 
nicotinylalanine + L-KYN, which have been shown to 
increase KYNA levels in the brain and delay the 
neurodegeneration process of PD under in vitro and in 
vivo conditions [157]. 
There are three possible ways to treat ALS. The first 
is inhibition of the enzyme in KP. The second target is the 
precursors of NAD or KYNA, such as nicotinamide 
mononucleotide, which have been used to treat aging and 
neurodegeneration [158]. The third is synthetic drugs with 
high bioavailability and affinity for excitatory receptor 
binding sites [119]. Although Riluzole was the first drug 
approved by the FDA to treat ALS in 1995 [144], there is 
still a lack of effective treatments for ALS today. 
Therefore, joint efforts of basic scientists and physician 
scientists in preclinical and clinical studies are needed. 
Reducing presynaptic dopamine or blocking the D2 
dopamine receptor is the current therapeutic strategy for 
treating chorea. Tetrabenazine is the only approved drug 
for treating chorea caused by HD [159]. IDO1 could be a 
new therapeutic target for HD by regulating inflammatory 
processes and neurodegeneration and inducing depressive 
symptoms 
in 
HD 
[145]. 
Similar 
to 
other 
neurodegenerative diseases, KMO inhibitors could also 
be a new therapeutic target for HD [160].

8. Conclusion 
 
In this review, we summarized and discussed the latest 
research on the TRP metabolic pathway and its primary 
metabolites, elucidated its pathogenic role in 12 types of 
CNS disease, and noted that KP-targeted drugs have 
therapeutic potential to treat CNS diseases. When the 
CNS is injured, the metabolic pathway of TRP switches 
to KP. Inhibition of MP reduces the release of melatonin 
accordingly (Tables 2 and 3). L-KYN has two metabolic 
pathways, the neurotoxic QUINA pathway and the 
neuroprotective KYNA pathway. In general, the activities 
of the metabolites of these two pathways antagonize each 
other. The QUINA pathway is overactivated in various 
CNS diseases, whereas the KYNA branch is inhibited. 
Therefore, therapeutic strategies that inhibit the QUINA 
pathway and promote the KYNA pathway can modulate 
TRP metabolism and improve the histological and 
functional outcomes of CNS diseases. Research on 
specific enzyme inhibitors in the KP pathway has much 
room for exploration, and we summarize relevant studies 
related to CNS diseases mainly in 2015-2022 in Table 4. 
Meanwhile, MP metabolites also have tremendous 
therapeutic potential for CNS diseases, and it is essential 
to investigate treatment options and administration routes 
related to 5-HT and melatonin. Continuous advances in 
preclinical and clinical research in this area can bring hope 
to the fight against various CNS diseases. Above all, 
relevant translational research is essential to identify 
therapeutic strategies for the treatment of traumatic 
conditions. Furthermore, exploring therapeutic options 
that simultaneously regulate KP and MP can maximize 
benefits, supporting the potential of targeting TRP 
metabolism.
