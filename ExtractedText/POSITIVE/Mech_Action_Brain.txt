Abstract: The involvement of the gut microbiota and the metabolites of colon-residing bacteria in
brain disease pathogenesis has been covered in a growing number of studies, but comparative litera-
ture is scarce. To ﬁll this gap, we explored the contribution of the microbiota–gut–brain axis to the
pathophysiology of seven brain-related diseases (attention deﬁcit hyperactivity disorder, autism spec-
trum disorder, schizophrenia, Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, major depressive disorder,
and bipolar disorder). In this article, we discussed changes in bacterial abundance and the metabolic
implications of these changes on disease development and progression. Our central ﬁndings indicate
that, mechanistically, all seven diseases are associated with a leaky gut, neuroinﬂammation, and
over-activated microglial cells, to which gut-residing bacteria and their metabolites are important
contributors. Patients show a pro-inﬂammatory shift in their colon microbiota, harbouring more
Gram-negative bacteria containing immune-triggering lipopolysaccharides (LPS) in their cell walls.
In addition, bacteria with pro-inﬂammatory properties (Alistipes, Eggerthella, Flavonifractor) are found
in higher abundances, whereas lower abundances of anti-inﬂammatory bacteria (Biﬁdobacterium,
Coprococcus, Eucbacterium, Eubacterium rectale, Faecalibacterium, Faecalibacterium prasunitzii, Lactobacillus,
Prevotella, Roseburia) are reported, when compared to healthy controls. On the metabolite level, aber-
rant levels of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) are involved in disease pathogenesis and are mostly
found in lower quantities. Moreover, bacterial metabolites such as neurotransmitters (acetylcholine,
dopamine, noradrenaline, GABA, glutamate, serotonin) or amino acids (phenylalanine, tryptophan)
also play an important role. In the future, deﬁned aberrations in the abundance of bacteria strains
and altered bacterial metabolite levels could likely be possible markers for disease diagnostics and
follow-ups. Moreover, they could help to identify novel treatment options, underlining the necessity
for a deeper understanding of the microbiota–gut–brain axis.

1. Introduction
Neuropsychiatric diseases cover a wide spectrum of diseases affecting the brain, be-
haviour, and mood, affecting people of any age. Neurodevelopmental disorders such
as attention deﬁcit hyperactivity disorder and autistic disorder are prevalent in children
and adolescents [1–4]. Affective disorders such as bipolar disorder or major depressive
disorder mainly affect young adults in their second to third life decade [5,6]. Neurode-
generative disorders, on the other hand, are present in the elderly (60–80 years) [7–10].
Worldwide, neuropsychiatric disorders are among the most disabling diseases causing
major impairments of life quality. Especially in schizophrenia, Alzheimer’s disease, and
bipolar disorder, life expectancy is massively reduced by as much as 10–20 years [7,8,11,12].
This highlights the importance of a profound understanding of the pathophysiological
mechanisms involved in disease development.

In recent years, the contribution of the gut microbiota and its metabolites in disease
development has become the centre of attention in science. Research focusing on the
microbiota–gut–brain axis has experienced a dramatic rise in recent decades, uncover-
ing several pathways connecting the residing intestinal bacteria and different somatic,
neurological, and psychiatric diseases. Disruptions in microbial compositions have been
implicated in diseases such as asthma, diabetes, inﬂammatory bowel disease, obesity, and
autism [13].
Microbial communities’ inﬂuence on the brain is complex, and the bidirectional com-
munication between the brain and the microorganisms relies on the bacteria’s ability to
produce various metabolites to interact with the hosts’ immune system and neurochem-
istry [14]. Many studies aiming at deciphering these interactions have been performed on
animal model organisms. Only recently, more human clinical studies have been conducted,
with the ultimate goal to use the newly gained knowledge to identify future treatment
options [14,15].
Existing literature primarily focuses on the relationship between the intestinal mi-
crobiome and individual diseases. There is still a lack of more comparative approaches.
In this review, we highlight the potential common characteristics of the involvement of
the microbiota–gut–brain axis in the pathogenesis of a wide variety of neuropsychiatric
diseases, covering a broad spectrum of pathologies, ranging from neurodevelopment to
neurodegeneration, psychiatric and affective disorders.
2. Materials and Methods
The goal of this literature review is to answer the following research questions: What
are potential overlapping changes in the gut microbiome in terms of bacterial strains
and bacterial metabolites in people suffering from common neurodevelopmental, neu-
rodegenerative, or mental/neuropsychiatric disorders? The discussed disorders include
attention deﬁcit hyperactivity disorder, autistic disorder, schizophrenia, Alzheimer’s dis-
ease, Parkinson’s disease, depression, and bipolar disorder. The literature research was
run on the databases PubMed and Scopus until the 31 January 2022 using the follow-
ing search and MeSH terms: “microbiota-gut-brain-axis”, “Gastrointestinal Microbiome”
[Mesh], “Schizophrenia” [Mesh], “Alzheimer Disease” [Mesh], “Parkinson Disease” [Mesh],
“Depression” [Mesh], “Bipolar Disorder” [Mesh], “Attention Deﬁcit Disorder with Hyper-
activity” [Mesh], “Autistic Disorder” [Mesh].

3. Evidence of Linking the Microbiome–Gut–Brain Axis to Brain Disorders
3.1. Microbiome
The human body is densely populated with microbes, where each body site has an
individual ﬂora. The microbiota in the gut is the biggest, with approximately 1014 living
microorganisms, including bacteria, viruses, archaea, eukaryotes, and fungi [14,16], which
is equivalent to the number of human cells in the body [17]. Altogether these microorgan-
isms are estimated to weigh around 2 kg. They encode over 232 million genes, suggesting
that they may be able to exhibit a huge metabolic capacity [14,17].
In this review, “microbiome” will solely refer to the bacteria residing in the colon.
Most bacteria of the intestinal microbiome are situated in the colon. Only relatively few

Nutrients 2022, 14, 2661
3 of 51
can be found in the stomach or the small intestine due to unfavourable living conditions
in these parts of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract (fast passage, gastric acid, bile, pancreas
juices) [16,17]. Over the human lifespan, the microbiome continues to evolve: it ﬁrst starts
developing in the womb and during birth, stabilises and increases in diversity during
childhood and adolescence [16,17], and is inﬂuenced by the ageing processes later on in
life [15]. Furthermore, it is also highly susceptible to environmental and lifestyle factors
such as drugs, antibiotics, toxins, stress, and diet [14,18–20], resulting in big interindividual
and temporal differences [15,16,21].
Even though gut bacteria populations are highly dynamic, the mature microbiome
after the age of three years is dominated by two phyla, namely Bacteroidetes and Firmi-
cutes [15,17]. In addition, looking at the most abundant genus, three enterotypes could
be distinguished: (i) Bacteroides, (ii) Prevotella, and (iii) Ruminococcus [22]. These en-
terotypes have been linked to different dietary patterns. Bacteroides enterotype, which
has only little Pretovella, is found in individuals with Western diets (high in saturated fats,
high in animal protein). Pretovella enterotype, in contrast, is present in people consuming
a plant-based diet (high in ﬁbres and carbohydrates) [21,23]. In addition to environmental
inﬂuences, twin studies have shown that the composition of the microbiome may also be
determined by genetic components [16,19].
A balance in the microbial composition is known as a state of eubiosis [18]. Bacteria
and humans have evolved together, forming a symbiotic host–microbiome relationship [16].
Gut microbes are important for gut motility, barrier homeostasis, maintenance of gut
integrity, regulation of the host immune system, absorption, and production of nutri-
ents [13,16]. If the bacterial composition is altered, also recognised as dysbiosis, those
beneﬁcial mechanisms might be disrupted [16]. In dysbiosis, potentially harmful and
inﬂammatory bacteria take overhand, leading to an imbalance in immune homeostasis
and increased permeability in the gut. This, in turn, allows the migration of bacteria from
the gut into blood circulation, which is a risk factor for systemic inﬂammation [18]. As a
result, intestinal dysbiosis has been linked to the pathogenesis of different diseases and
unfavourable health conditions such as obesity, asthma, diabetes, autism, and inﬂamma-
tory bowel disease [13]. A disrupted microbiome has also been associated with different
neuropsychiatric diseases, including depression, autistic disorder, Parkinson’s disease,
and schizophrenia [19]. Extensive research, especially during the last decade, has been
instrumental in revealing the importance of gut microbiota for host health. The question of
whether dysbiosis is the underlying root cause of those diseases or the effect of the disease
pathologies still needs to be understood [17].
3.2. Microbiota–Gut–Brain Axis (MGBA)
The microbiota–gut–brain axis (MGBA) is a bidirectional communication pathway
between the gut bacteria and the central nervous system (CNS) [14,15]. It is an extension of
the gut–brain axis, in which the enteric nervous system (ENS), CNS, and the GI-tract work
together to affect physiological aspects of the gut: motility, secretion, and acid and mucus
production [24].
Within this complex communication network (Figure 1), several different routes of
interaction have been described. The bacteria may inﬂuence the brain via the production of
neurotransmitters and bacterial metabolites via stimulation of the vagal nerve, the immune
system, or the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis (HPA-axis) [13,14]. On the other hand,
the brain’s effects on the gut in terms of secretion, peristalsis, and sensory are mainly
transferred via the vagus nerve [25]. Due to the complexity of the system further work is
still required to understand the details of the bidirectional communication pathways [21].
Nonetheless, we will highlight some major ways of communication here.

Nutrients 2022, 14, 2661

Figure 1. Schematic overview of the bidirectional communication pathways between the gut-
microbiota and the brain (Microbiome–Gut–Brain Axis (MGBA)). The colon is inhabited by many
different bacteria strains, which directly or indirectly interact with the nerve cells and the brain.
The direct pathway includes cytokine signalling after recognition of bacteria through immune cells.
Cytokines may also stimulate the body’s stress response via upregulating the hypothalamic–pituitary–
adrenal axis (HPA-axis). Indirectly, the bacteria can communicate with their metabolites: utilising
dietary ﬁbres, they produce short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), which are important for epithelium
cells and enter the systemic blood circulation. Certain strains of bacteria can produce amino acids or
neuroactive metabolites, such as neurotransmitters, which gain access to the brain through blood
circulation. Furthermore, bacteria can stimulate enteroendocrine cells, which themselves release
hormones into the bloodstream. The bacterial metabolites can also send afferent signals to the brain
through enteric nerve cells belonging to the ENS and the vagus nerve. On the other hand, the
brain inﬂuences important aspects (e.g., motility and mucus secretion) of gut physiology through
efferent signals travelling along the vagus nerve and ENS cells. The arrows show the direction of the
individual communication pathways and the different signalling stations involved.
3.2.1. Chemical Signalling
Certain types of bacteria can produce small molecules which inﬂuence the metabolism
of the nervous system, either directly or indirectly. This path is referred to as chemical
signalling [14].
Short-Chain Fatty Acids (SCFAs)
Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) are saturated fatty acids with a maximal chain length of
six carbon atoms synthesised by colonic bacteria [26]. SCFAs derive from polysaccharides
found in dietary ﬁbres, which cannot be broken down by our own digestive enzymes. In
contrast, bacteria in the intestines digest those through a process of anaerobic fermentation.
The two most important bacteria in this SCFA production are Bacteroides spp. and Clostridiae
spp. [27–29]. Acetate, propionate, and butyrate are the most abundant SCFAs in the
colon [20,26].
After their synthesis, SCFAs might exert a direct impact on the gut and support local
gut health, or they may be distributed by systemic blood circulation throughout the body,
affecting other organs, including the brain. In the gut itself, SCFAs are quickly absorbed

Nutrients 2022, 14, 2661

by colonocytes and act as the main source of energy for the intestinal lining. Absorbed
SCFAs inﬂuence the cell’s metabolism. They play an important role in increasing mucous
production within the GI tract and enhance the integrity of the gut barrier by upregulating
the expression of tight junction proteins. Tight junctions are speciﬁc connections between
cells (here gastrointestinal epithelial cells), contributing to a physical barrier. A functional
gut barrier is crucial for preventing the entrance of pathogens and waste products into the
body whilst enabling the uptake of important molecules and nutrients. It also prevents the
body from systemic inﬂammation, which is associated with numerous diseases. Prevention
of such systemic inﬂammation further reduces the risk for subsequent neuroinﬂammation
because through systemic inﬂammation, the blood–brain barrier (BBB) might be impaired.
Neuroinﬂammation, in turn, leads to compromised brain health [18,26,29]. This sums up
the immune pathway of SCFA–brain interaction. In addition, tight junctions are an integral
component of the BBB. A regulatory effect of SCFAs on the permeability of this barrier was
shown in animal models [29].
Systemically, SCFAs can have direct or indirect effects on the MGBA. The indirect
pathway is mediated by affecting the immune or the endocrine system, while direct sig-
nalling is the result of the neuroactive characteristics of SCFAs. Once SCFAs reach the brain
through systemic circulation, they can cross the BBB and bind to speciﬁc G-protein-coupled
receptors (GPCRs) expressed in CNS tissue. GPCR-activation may then inﬂuence the gene
expression (epigenetic modulation) in the correspondent nerve cells. For example, the
inhibition of histone deacetylation results in more transcriptionally active chromatin (hyper-
acetylated histones). The inhibited enzymes, histone deacetylases (HDACs), are thought to
be associated with brain development and also with a variety of neuropsychiatric disorders
such as depression, Alzheimer’s disease, or schizophrenia [18,20,26].
In addition to the two abovementioned examples, other possible mechanisms by
which SCFAs affect the brain include their impact on modulating the levels of neurotrophic
factors such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), the synthesis of serotonin, and
the production of enteroendocrine cell-derived hormones such as GLP1 or PYY [26].
Amino Acids and Neurotransmitters
Some gut bacteria possess the ability to produce neuroactive substances, including
amino acids and neurotransmitters [14]. As exemplarily shown in Table 1, the inhibitory
neurotransmitter GABA can be produced by Lactobacillus spp. or Biﬁdobacterium spp.
Acetylcholine is synthesised by Lactobacillus spp. Noradrenaline is produced by Bacil-
lus spp., Escherichia spp., and Saccharomyces spp. Serotonin is produced by Streptococcus
spp., Candida spp., Enterococcus spp., and Escherichia spp. Dopamine is produced by Bacil-
lus spp. [18,20].

Those microbial neurotransmitters are thought to have a more local than peripheral
effect. They might cross the intestinal epithelial cells, but their area of action is limited to
the surrounding ENS. Even upon reaching the bloodstream, they will be unable to cross
the BBB and therefore cannot enter the brain and are unable to inﬂuence brain chemistry.
Indirect inﬂuences on the brain, by acting on the ENS, are possible. For comprehensive
reviews, see [14,20].
In contrast, certain precursors of neurotransmitters, namely amino acids, are capable
of crossing the BBB [30]. The levels of circulating tryptophan, the precursor for serotonin
(5-HT), can be elevated by Biﬁdobacterium infantis [20]. Within the brain, tryptophan can
then be further the bolized into 5-HT and impact brain chemistry [20,28],[30]. Similarly,
the genus Biﬁdobacterium increases the level of phenylalanine, the precursor for the amino
acid tyrosine, which itself again is a precursor for the two neurotransmitters dopamine
and noradrenaline in the brain [27]. Increased or decreased abundance of such precursor-
producing bacteria shifts the availability of monoamine neurotransmitters in the brain and
paves the way for related diseases and behavioural changes [30].
3.2.2. Immune System Signalling
Intestines harbour the largest number of immune cells in the human body, allowing
the body to scan all the transitioning food and also the symbiotic gut-residing bacteria for
potential pathogens or toxins [21]. With the help of pathogen-associated molecular pattern
(PAMP) recognition receptors, intestinal cells can detect certain parts of bacteria such as
lipopolysaccharide (LPS). LPS is a characteristic cell wall component of Gram-negative
bacteria. Innate immune cells are equipped with Toll-like receptors (TLRs), which are
the most studied family of PAMP recognition receptors. LPS activates TLRs. Through
this activation, Gram-negative bacterial invasion is identiﬁed, and an innate immune
response is triggered, which involves many signalling molecules, including cytokines
and the recruitment of inﬂammatory cells [21,31]. Immune signalling (production and
peripheral secretion of cytokines) is also mediated to the brain via the bloodstream. Recent
research has suggested that in the area of the hypothalamus, cytokines can cross the
locally more permeable BBB, although they are generally incapable of crossing the BBB.
In the hypothalamus, the major physiological stress response system, the hypothalamus–
pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis, has its starting point. Originally from the gut-derived pro-
inﬂammatory cytokines, interleukin (IL)-1 and IL-6 can activate the HPA axis. Subsequently,
body cortisol levels rise, and the body enters the stress response mode [20,21]. Multiple
neuropsychiatric diseases and pathological conditions have been linked to a dysregulated
stress axis and altered immune signalling within the brain, of which depression and
autism spectrum disorder are just two examples [14]. Peripheral systemic inﬂammation,
which is driven by circulating immune signalling molecules such as cytokines, is also a
major factor in the pathophysiology of many diseases, including brain disorders. Through
systemic inﬂammation, the BBB becomes disrupted and more permeable for bacterial
metabolic products. It is not surprising that the condition of a disrupted BBB facilitates
the development of different neuropathologies due to the compromised protective barrier
against toxic substances [14].
Another important aspect of the intertwining of the gut microbiome and the immune
system is found in microglia cells. Microglia cells are the major component of the brain’s
immune system and belong to the group of innate immune cells. They register changes in
the molecular milieu in the brain. Activated microglia cells trigger an immune response by
producing different cytokines and chemokines. Therefore, they are key players in neuroin-
ﬂammatory processes and in the regulation of brain homeostasis [21]. Their development
and maturation highly depend on gut bacteria, as a wide diversity in bacteria strains is
important [14,21]. As a result, dysfunction of microglial cells due to reduced complexity
in the microbiome could be linked to neurodegenerative or behavioural disorders, where
neuroinﬂammation and disturbed tissue homeostasis act as driving aetiological factors [14].

3.2.3. Neural Signalling
The intestines are innervated by both ENS and the autonomic nervous system (ANS),
of which the vagus nerve (10th cranial nerve) is known to be the most direct connection
between the CNS and the gut. Approximately 80% of all nerve ﬁbres in the vagus nerve
are afferent; the remaining 20% carry efferent signals from the CNS to the periphery. With
both efferent and afferent ﬁbres, the basis for bidirectional communication is already given,
either bottom-up (gut to the brain via afferent ﬁbres) or top-down (efferent ﬁbres from the
brain to the gut) [14,21]. ANS and ENS are both implicated in the physiological homeostasis
of the gut and regulate motility, mucous production, and transition time [21]. The initial
formation of the ENS takes place during embryogenesis, but differentiation and maturation
processes occur later on after birth. These processes are thought to be inﬂuenced by
gut microbial development, which takes place simultaneously [14,15,21]. ENS and CNS
are functionally interconnected through the use of the same signalling molecules [15,21].
Hence, the identiﬁed effects that gut microbiota has on local neurons resemble those
discussed earlier in the above paragraphs discussing chemical and immune signalling.
Those mechanisms include activation of PAMP recognition receptors such as TLRs through
LPS, SCFA signalling, and stimulation of mechanoreceptors or chemoreceptors, which sense
neurotransmitters, hormones, or metabolic products. Local neuronal stimulation on the
ENS level by bacterial metabolites is thought to be then transmitted to the brain via vagal
nerve conduction [14]. Metabolites and neurotransmitters can either be directly produced
by gut bacteria or secreted by enteroendocrine cells (EECs), which are also affected by gut
microbes [14,21].
In addition, the very physical link from the gut to the brain is seemingly important for
some neurodegenerative pathogeneses. In Parkinson’s disease, for example, the accumula-
tion of α-synuclein protein within the brain and neurons is the prime disease hallmark. It
is suggested that certain gut bacteria promote α-synuclein accumulation in intestinal nerve
ﬁbres, which are hypothesised to be then transported along the axons of the vagus nerve to
the CNS, where they spread even further from neuron to neuron through trans-synaptic
transport [20,32]. This hypothesis is backed by the fact that α-synuclein aggregations were
detected in the ENS neurons of the submucosal and myenteric plexuses much earlier than
they could be found in the brain [20,32] and highlights the importance of the communi-
cation between the ENS, CNS, and the gut microbiome in the pathophysiology of brain
disorders [21].
4. Changes in Gut Microbiota and Metabolites in Brain-Related Pathologies
4.1. Attention Deﬁcit Disorder with Hyperactivity
Attention deﬁcit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a neurodevelopmental disease
with an early onset consisting of the three main symptoms inattentiveness, impulsivity,
and/or hyperactivity [1,27]. With a worldwide prevalence of 5.29%, ADHD is one of the
most common mental illnesses amongst children and adolescents [1,2]. In total, 70–80% of
the risk for developing ADHD is made up of genetic components, whereas the remaining
20–30% has been linked to environmental risk factors such as premature birth, toxins, diet,
and psychosocial distress [1,18,33,34]. The exact underlying mechanisms of aetiopatho-
genesis remain unclear [35]. Several known pathomechanisms in ADHD, both direct and
indirect, have been linked to the gastrointestinal microbiota by three possible ways of
interaction: (i) direct production of neuroactive metabolites/neurotransmitters, (ii) vagal
nerve stimulation, (iii) interactions via the immune system [28,33,36].
One widely accepted hypothesis on the ADHD pathophysiology highlights the dys-
function of the monoamine neurotransmitters dopamine (DA), noradrenaline (NE), and
serotonin (5-HT), which are involved in the rewarding and motivational processes in the
brain. This hypothesis is further supported by the fact that the current medications treating
ADHD target the monoaminergic system and increase the concentration of the neurotrans-
mitters in the synaptic cleft by blocking their re-uptake [18,27,35,37]. The production of
those neurotransmitters can be inﬂuenced by gut bacteria.

Nutrients 2022, 14, 2661

Biﬁdobacterium of the phylum Actinobacteria, for example, encodes an enzyme known
as arogenate dehydratase (ADT), which is important for the production of phenylalanine
an essential amino acid. The latter can pass the BBB and is metabolised into the amino acid
tyrosine, which can further be turned into DA and then NE in the brain [27,30]. Aarts et al.
compared faeces samples of ADHD patients (n = 19) to samples of a healthy control group
(n = 66). They found that the relative abundance of Actinobacteria was increased in ADHD
patients, whereas Firmicutes were slightly reduced compared to the control group. No
changes in the phylum Bacteroidetes were observed. Within the phylum, Actinobacterium,
especially the genus Biﬁdobacterium, marked a signiﬁcant increase [30]. As mentioned above,
Biﬁdobacterium is equipped with ADT and thus involved in dopamine synthesis, which is
an important neurotransmitter within the brain reward response, which is dysfunctional
in patients with ADHD. Therefore, these ﬁndings suggest that there is a link between the
microbiome and ADHD [28,30].
Whereas the work conducted by Aarts et al. displays a potential mode of interaction
between intestinal dysbiosis and neurotransmitter disturbance, similar research is needed
focusing on the involvement of gut bacteria and precursors of NE or 5-HT (i.e., tyrosine and
tryptophan) in the pathophysiology of ADHD, as no such studies could be identiﬁed. It is
suggested that a similar mode of action applies and that the precursors produced by bacteria
are absorbed by the gut epithelium and carried to the brain via blood circulation, where
they can cross the BBB and potentially inﬂuence the brain chemistry and the monoamine-
induced functioning [18,30].
ADHD patients exhibited a lower level of circulating 5-HT in comparison with
healthy individuals in a clinical study. A preclinical study with germ-free (GF) mice
conﬁrmed these [28,36]. The precursor of 5-HT, amino acid tryptophan, can be syn-
thesised by Biﬁdobacterium spp., Lactobacilli spp., Clostridium sporogenes, and Clostridium
bartettii [28], and 5-HT itself can be produced by other bacteria namely Streptococcus spp.,
Enterococcus spp., and Escherichia spp. [27], of which Biﬁdobacteria [27,30,33], Lactobacilli [33],
and Clostridia [30] were altered in patients with ADHD (see Table 2).

BDNF is a neurotrophic factor important for the survival of neurons as well as neu-
rogenesis. The gut microbes are capable of regulating BDNF levels via the production of
SCFAs. In ADHD, an increase in SCFAs through a ﬁbre-rich diet was positively correlated
with raising BDNF levels, which ultimately might improve ADHD symptoms [27].
Other studies, which compared faeces of ADHD patients and healthy controls, did not
report any clear differences in bacteria strains between the two groups and could not draw
a clear correlation between Biﬁdobacterium, higher phenylalanine levels, and subsequently
dysfunctional dopamine signalling in the rewarding response [27,30].
Overall, only a few studies on changes in gut microbiota in ADHD patients have
been published, and further work needs to be conducted to obtain more data and less
divergent results [28,33]. Generally, ADHD is associated with a reduction in microbiota
diversity, although the ﬁndings were relatively heterogenous [28,33]. Moreover, the genera
Bacteroides and Biﬁdobacterium were identiﬁed as possible biomarkers for ADHD in children
and adolescents by two research groups. In particular, a decrease in Biﬁdobacterium has
been mentioned as a risk factor [28,30]. The ﬁndings of the different studies regarding
microbial changes in ADHD patients are listed down below in Table 2 and in Figure 2.
Additionally, the altered microbiome could induce gut barrier permeability and bac-
terial leakage, which leads to a systemic increase in LPS and pro-inﬂammatory cytokine
levels. As mentioned earlier, those cytokines are potent activators for the HPA axis, creating
a state of chronic stress [33]. In ADHD patients, such HPA-hyperactivation is detected
by measuring morning cortisol levels. In addition, pro-inﬂammatory cytokines are also
involved in microglial activation and neuroinﬂammation, which have been linked to the
pathogenesis of ADHD [27]. Lastly, the ANS with the vagus nerve showed alterations in
ADHD patients. To which extent the vagus nerve is involved in the pathogenesis remains
unclear, but studies have shown that patients suffer from an underactive parasympathetic

and overactive sympathetic nervous system, although the ﬁndings were not consistent
throughout all research groups [27,36]. As the vagus nerve is also involved in the re-
warding system, which is known to be altered in ADHD patients, the hypothesis seems
plausible [27,36].
Figure 2. Visual representation of the changes in microbiota composition in ADHD patients from
Table 2. The pedigree design highlights the taxonomic classiﬁcation of the dysbiotic bacteria. Light
green cells stand for an increase and the light red cells for a decrease, respectively. Signiﬁcant
changes are shown in bold letters (p < 0.05 or LDA values > 2). White cells indicate that no changes
were reported. The last two columns contain additional, non-exhaustive information on how the
bacteria are thought to impact the pathogenesis. The second last column to the right depicts bacterial
molecular factors, which may be components of the bacteria or bacterial metabolites. Finally, the
last column lists possible mechanisms by which these molecular factors may interfere with disease
development. The colours summarise factors or mechanisms that are repetitive. Bacterial production
of GABA (light blue, [36]), tryptophan (turquoise, [28]), acetylcholine (emerald colour, [18,20]),
phenylalanine (dark orange, [27]), or 5-HT (salmon colour, [28]) may lead to an imbalance in central
nervous system neurotransmitters (yellow). Gram-negative bacteria’s cell wall containing LPS (light
purple) can stimulate TLRs located on immune cells (lilac, [21,31]). TLR-mediated immune activation
is eventually leading to systemic inﬂammation, BBB disturbance, and neuroinﬂammation [14]. SCFAs
deriving from bacteria are involved in microglia maturation and activation, BDNF-production,
tight junction regulation in the gut barrier as well as in the BBB, epigenetic and inﬂammatory
processes (light orange, [18,20,26,29]). 5-HT = serotonin; ADHD = attention deﬁcit hyperactivity
disorder; BBB = blood–brain barrier; BDNF = brain-derived neurotrophic factor; GABA = gamma-
Aminobutyric acid; LPS = lipopolysaccharide; SCFA = short-chain fatty acid; TLR = Toll-like receptor.
4.2. Autistic Spectrum Disorder
Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) describes a heterogenous group of neurodevel-
opmental disorders, mainly affecting children [3,4]. The diagnosis is based on clinical
observation of behavioural aberrations and diagnostic interviews [4,41]. The key charac-
teristics of ASD are deﬁcits in social interaction and communication, along with repetitive

Nutrients 2022, 14, 2661
11 of 51
patterns of behaviours and cognitive difﬁculties [3,4]. ASD prevalence has increased in
recent years, and 1–1.5% of the world’s population is affected [4]. Current estimations
predict that 1 in 68 up to 1 in 36 children suffer from ASD [41,42]. Interestingly, compared
to girls, boys show a four- to ﬁve-fold higher prevalence [3,42]. Brain development and
reorganisation are altered in ASD patients [4]. Some of the ﬁndings are increased brain
volume, which could be seen in neuroimages, and changes in brain connectivity compared
to neurotypical children [4,42,43]. Aetiology is thought to be an interplay of genetics and
environmental factors. Approximately 10–20% of ASD cases are attributed to genetic mech-
anisms [3,41]. Polluted air, maternal infections, high parental age, pesticides, preterm birth,
and certain drug exposures during pregnancy are some of the environmental factors which
have been associated with an increased risk for ASD [3,4].
Autistic patients often also suffer from GI symptoms such as diarrhoea, bloating,
constipation, and abdominal pain. They appear more often in ASD patients than in healthy
children, and constipation was found to be the most common GI symptom among them [44].
Thus, it is not surprising that researchers started investigating the role of the MGBA in
ASD pathogenesis. Even more so, because the brain’s development, including synapse
formation and growth, timely coincides with the maturation of the gut’s microbiome. Both
processes mainly happen within a critical developmental time window until the age of two
to three years [44].
Many studies revealed that the microbiome of ASD patients is different from those of
healthy individuals. Some changes could be proven repeatedly by independent researchers,
but also inconsistent and contradictory results were collected. Possible reasons for the
discrepancy could lie in the patient’s origin, diet, lifestyle but also methodological differ-
ences [45]. Nevertheless, the data has shown that autistic children harbour a shifted ratio
between the two phyla Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes in faecal and biopsy samples. Levels
of Firmicutes were mostly increased, and those of Bacteroidetes decreased [3,44–46]. Addi-
tionally, several researchers measured a higher abundance of Clostridium spp. and lower
levels of Biﬁdobacterium spp. and Enterococcus spp. [3,44]. SCFA-producing bacteria such as
Bacteroides spp., Clostridia spp., and Desulfovibrio spp. could be found in higher abundance,
which is consistent with higher SCFA levels in blood and stool of ASD patients [3,45].
Phylum Actinobacterium, class Betaproteobacteria, genera Dialister, Faecalibacterium, Lacto-
bacillus, and Ruminococcus also marked an increased presence [45,46]. ASD patients had
decreased levels of bacteria involved in degenerating and fermenting carbohydrates such
as Coprococcus, Prevotella, and Veilonella [43,46]. In contrast, Suturella could be found in
higher abundance, which is important for the regulation of mucosa metabolism and the
integrity of the intestinal epithelium [43]. In the future, screening for such bacterial com-
position aberrations could be helpful in ASD diagnosis and a potential target for novel
therapeutic approaches, including faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) or beneﬁcial
probiotic bacteria supplementation [44]. A more detailed list of the studies’ can be found
in Table 3 and a visual representation in Figures 3 and 4.The lack of consensus among the
studies indicates that further research is needed to describe microbiome characteristics in
ASD patients.
The changed microbiome and bacterial metabolites inﬂuence the permeability of the
intestinal lining. Increased permeability in the gut is linked to reduced tight junctions
in the epithelium. A lower abundance of Lactobacillus strains, as seen in ASD patients,
could be a possible cause for increased permeability regarding their role in tight junction
maintenance [44]. Additionally, the levels of tight junction component zonulin were seen to
be altered in children with ASD [3]. Hence, bacterial metabolites can cross the gut barrier
more easily. Higher levels of circulating LPS were found in ASD patients [44,45]. Its leakage
can stimulate the immune system. Indeed, elevated pro-inﬂammatory cytokine levels,
including IL-1β, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, IFN-γ, TGF-β, and TNF-α, were measured in autistic pa-
tients. This subsequently triggers systemic inﬂammation and compromises the function of
the BBB, eventually leading to neuroinﬂammation [43,45,47]. Post-mortem studies of ASD
patients’ brains conﬁrmed BBB impairment and revealed increased microglial activation as

Nutrients 2022, 14, 2661
12 of 51
a sign of neuroinﬂammation [44,45]. In living ASD patients, positron emission tomography
(PET) scans were performed and indirectly showed increased microglia activation [43].
Synapse malfunction is regarded as a potential result of CNS inﬂammation [44]. Thus,
gut dysbiosis and associated neuroinﬂammation in early life stages may interfere with
neurodevelopment [46].

Figure 3. Part 1 of visual representation of the changes in microbiota composition in autism spectrum
disorder patients from Table 3. For an explanation, see the legend of Part 2 in Figure 4.
Concentrations of free aromatic amino acids phenylalanine, tryptophan, and tyrosine
were increased in faeces of ASD individuals [46]. Different bacterial metabolites showed
altered patterns in ASD children compared to healthy controls. Two of them are the
metabolic by-product of Clostridia: 3-(3-hydroxyphenyl)-3-hydroxypropionic acid (HPHPA)
(an abnormal phenylalanine metabolite) and para-cresol (p-cresol) (which derives from
tyrosine metabolism). Increased HPHPA and p-cresol were consistent with the higher
Clostridium abundance [3,47]. HPHPA can potentially deplete catecholamines in the brain,
such as dopamine, adrenaline, and noradrenaline produced by the adrenal gland. This is
believed to contribute to typical ASD symptoms such as hyperactivity and stereotypical
behaviour [46,47]. P-cresol has also been associated with repetitive behaviour patterns [3].

Nutrients 2022, 14, 2661

It can inhibit the enzyme dopamine-beta-hydroxylase, which converts dopamine into nora-
drenaline and therefore regulates dopamine metabolism in the brain [44,46]. Furthermore,
p-cresol acts as a marker for a leaky gut once it is found in the systemic circulation because
the GI tract is the only production site [44]. P-cresol is further associated with processes
such as apoptosis, DNA damage, and inﬂammation [46].

inﬂammation (brown) [3,44]. Clostridium spp. can further synthesise p-cresol and HPHPA, which both
interfere with neurotransmitter balance [3,47]. Prevotella copri produces vitamin B1, but its involve-
ment in pathophysiology remains unknown [44]. Gram-negative bacteria’s cell wall containing LPS
(light purple) can stimulate TLRs located on immune cells (lilac, [21,31]). TLR-mediated immune acti-
vation is eventually leading to systemic inﬂammation, BBB disturbance, and neuroinﬂammation [14].
SCFAs deriving from bacteria are involved in microglia maturation and activation, BDNF-production,
tight junction regulation in the gut barrier as well as in the BBB, epigenetic and inﬂammatory
processes (light orange, [18,20,26,29]). If the involvement of the bacterial strain in the disease patho-
genesis remains elusive, the last two columns are labelled as unknown, respectively. 5-HT = serotonin;
ASD = autism spectrum disorder; BBB = blood–brain barrier; BDNF = brain-derived neurotrophic
factor; GABA = gamma-Aminobutyric acid; GI = gastrointestinal; HPHPA = 3-(3-hydroxyphenyl)-
3-hydroxypropionic acid; LPS = lipopolysaccharide; NE = noradrenaline; p-cresol = para-cresol;
SCFA = short-chain fatty acid; TLR = Toll-like receptor.
Elevated concentrations of the neurotransmitters serotonin and GABA were registered
in autistic children [44]. An abnormal serotonergic system within the brain is involved
in ASD pathogenesis, considering the pivotal role of this neurotransmitter in the CNS
development throughout the foetal period and early stages of life [45]. Tryptophan is the
precursor of serotonin, and in autistic individuals, Burkholderia spp. and Pseudomonas spp.,
which belong to the phylum Proteobacteria, are thought to be involved with the reinforced
tryptophan pathway and the promotion of disordered neurobehaviour [45]. Abnormal
GABA and glutamate levels found in ASD patients might also be connected to microbiota
changes as some Biﬁdobacterium spp. and Lactobacillus are recognised GABA producers [44,
45]. Excess glutamate has neurotoxic properties and may induce neuronal apoptosis [44].
The exact mechanism of GABA and glutamate involvement in ASD pathogenesis remains
unclear [46].
Finally, in most studies, SCFAs were found in lower concentrations in ASD children
compared to healthy control children [44,46]. Their synthesis depends on anaerobic bac-
teria such as Biﬁdobacterium, Prevotella, and Ruminococcus, which were decreased in ASD
patients [46]. They have the potential to inﬂuence early brain development after crossing
the BBB since they are involved in the modulation of dopamine and serotonin produc-
tion [3,44]. The expression of tryptophan 5-hydroxylase, an enzyme in serotonin synthesis,
is inﬂuenced by SCFAs, as well as the expression of tyrosine hydroxylase, which is of impor-
tance in the biosynthesis of dopamine, adrenaline, and noradrenaline [45]. SCFAs further
regulate CNS physiology by inﬂuencing microglial maturation, neuronal signalling, and
epigenetics [45]. Epigenetic alterations are mainly attributed to butyrate, which modulates
HDAC activity. HDAC inhibition might impact ASD genesis by changing gene expression.
One of the genes affected by these epigenetic processes is the transcription factor cAMP
response element-binding protein (CREB), which is known to be implicated in neurodevel-
opment and brain function processes [29,46]. Furthermore, apoptosis and inﬂammation
processes have been linked to epigenetic alterations mediated by SCFAs [46]. Therefore, it
is plausible that SCFA disturbances originating from intestinal dysbiosis are involved in
ASD pathogenesis, even though the mechanisms need to be further investigated [45].
4.3. Schizophrenia
Schizophrenia is a psychiatric syndrome with a worldwide prevalence of 1% and is
rated among the 10 most common causes of disability on a global level [11,60]. The psy-
chotic symptoms range from delusions and hallucinations to disorganised speech. Other
symptoms are a decrease in motivation, a diminishment in expressivity, and grossly disor-
ganised or catatonic behaviour. Schizophrenic patients might also suffer from cognitive
deﬁcits such as reduced speed in mental processes or memory problems [11,60]. Usually,
schizophrenia is ﬁrstly diagnosed in early adulthood (late teens or early twenties) but
might be preceded by a prodromal phase with minor changes in behaviour and cogni-
tive function [60]. Because of the early onset and the potential for life-long impairments,
schizophrenia is associated with a huge burden for both the health care system and the

Nutrients 2022, 14, 2661
17 of 51
economy. Furthermore, the personal burden of disease should not be neglected as, in
addition to the life-long impairments, the mean life expectancy is reduced by 15 years
compared to the general population [11]. Twin and family studies concluded that 80% of
the risk for schizophrenia could be explained by genetics. No single disease-causing gene
could be identiﬁed, so it is thought to be a polygenic disorder [11,60]. The remaining 20%
are made up of environmental factors such as birth complications, childhood adversity
(emotional or physical abuse, neglect, family dysfunction), urban area upbringing, alcohol,
drugs, malnutrition, infections, or stress [60,61].
Over the last three decades, research has started to focus on the role of immune
functions in schizophrenia pathogenesis. It has been suggested that schizophrenia is a
low-grade chronic inﬂammatory disease. Neuroinﬂammation in the CNS and the periphery
could be associated with schizophrenia, in which overly activated neuroimmune microglia
cells play a crucial role [62]. Schizophrenia patients had altered activation of microglia
compared to a healthy control group. Alterations in the microbiome, especially in early
life, act as a predisposition to immune dysfunction, which has been associated with the
development of schizophrenia [62,63]. As discussed earlier, microglial development partly
depends on gut microbial inﬂuences, a fact that supports a potential involvement of
microbiome-derived cues in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia.
An altered microbiome and dysbiosis, along with a disrupted gut barrier and bacterial
translocation (leaky gut), have been linked to schizophrenia. Several research groups
detected elevated levels of serum biomarkers for microbial translocation, such as circu-
lating LPS, LPS-binding protein (LBP), and soluble CD14 (sCD14) in patients’ blood sam-
ples [61–65]. These factors activate the immune system by binding to TLRs. TLR4, which
recognises LPS, has been found in higher abundance in patients with schizophrenia [63],
possibly leading to the impairment of BBB, neuroinﬂammation, microglial activation, and
neuronal damage with deleterious consequences for cognitive functions [62]. Altogether,
these data emphasise a correlation between schizophrenia and the elevated levels of pro-
inﬂammatory cytokines involved in the immune response [61].
Various studies evaluated key changes in microbiome composition in schizophrenia.
Only a limited number of ﬁndings overlapped. Even the question of whether the overall
diversity in gut microbiota was increased or decreased in schizophrenia patients cannot be
answered beyond any doubt since the ﬁndings regarding alpha- and beta-diversity were in-
consistent [63–66]. A compilation of the bacteria analyses can be found in Table 4, as well as
in Figures 5 and 6.The diverse ﬁndings suggest that further studies with bigger sample sizes
and eradication of cofounding factors are necessary to identify schizophrenia-related bacte-
ria. Even for the bacteria that have been associated more clearly, their biological mechanism
and role in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia remain largely unknown [63,66].
Associations between changes in bacterial metabolites found in schizophrenia patients
and the disease development are clearer. The impact of translocation biomarkers and
cytokines on the pathology of schizophrenia has already been discussed above. Studying
faecal samples revealed that schizophrenia patients show alterations in their gut glutamate
metabolism. In the gut, the activity of glutamine oxoglutarate aminotransferase (GOGAT),
which is involved in glutamate synthesis, was signiﬁcantly higher than in healthy con-
trols. This results in elevated levels of glutamate [65,66]. The neurotransmitter dopamine
is seemingly important for psychosis symptoms such as delusions and hallucinations.
In schizophrenia, overstimulation of dopamine receptors D2 in the striatum leading to
these symptoms has been postulated. On a pharmacological level, these D2 receptors are
blocked by antipsychotic drugs, reducing psychotic symptoms. Dopamine levels in the
brain depend at least partly on gut microbiome metabolism, as discussed earlier [61,63].
Furthermore, changes in tryptophan metabolism could be identiﬁed, which are also thought
to emerge from bacterial metabolism. In addition to being turned into serotonin, trypto-
phan can also be metabolised through the kynurenine pathway. In Schizophrenia, higher
levels of kynurenine metabolites could be measured [61,63,66]. Within the brain, astrocytes
metabolise kynurenine into kynurenic acid, which is an antagonist to acetylcholine and

Nutrients 2022, 14, 2661
18 of 51
glutamate receptors. Those receptors are involved in brain development, behaviour, and
cognition. Altered levels of kynurenine and kynurenic acid have therefore been linked to
the pathophysiology of schizophrenia [63]. SCFAs are also thought to be of importance.
Research ﬁndings suggest that their epigenetic modulation potential via decreasing HDAC
activity could be crucial in the development of schizophrenia, keeping in mind that 80% of
the risk for schizophrenia is attributed to genetics [61,66].

4.4. Alzheimer’s Disease
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the single most common cause of dementia, making up
approximately 60–70% of all dementia cases [7,8]. As it is strongly associated with ageing,
it is thought to become even more prevalent in the future with the general population
ageing due to increasing life expectancy. Currently, already more than 44 million people
are affected on a global level, and therefore it is a rising global health problem [7,8]. AD
ﬁrstly presents itself with a progression in cognitive impairment, starting with difﬁculties in
episodic memory and remembering new information, further affecting spatial orientation
and executive functions. In later stages of the disease, personality changes may occur,
and activities of daily life are affected; dressing, eating, and mobility become impossible.
This leads to patients’ dependence and disability with a high need for care. AD further
reduces life expectancy, as death occurs about 8–10 years after the initial presentation of the
disease [7,8].
Ageing and genetic proﬁle are the non-modiﬁable risk factors for AD [7]. AD is
sporadic in most cases (sAD). Rarely is it inherited in an autosomal-dominant way, where
symptoms develop as early as the age of 30 to 50 years. Genetic factors are also involved in
sporadic AD, contributing to approximately 70% of the risk of developing sAD. Variations
in the apolipoprotein E (APOE) gene are the single biggest genetic risk factor for sAD [8,70].
The remaining 30% of the risk is modiﬁable and connected to environmental and lifestyle
factors, including cardiovascular risk factors (hypertension, physical inactivity, obesity,
smoking, diabetes) and reduced cognitive activity [7].
The cognitive impairment in AD is caused by irreversible neuronal death and synaptic
loss. The accumulation of insoluble and misfolded amyloid-beta (Aβ) proteins is caused
by a different secretase cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) or by reduced

Nutrients 2022, 14, 2661
21 of 51
clearance of Aβ, where APOE is involved. Aβ then forms extracellular amyloid plaques
and accelerates the hyperphosphorylation of tau protein, which forms intraneuronal neu-
roﬁbrillary tangles (NFTs). Aβ and NFT activate a neurotoxic pathway leading to a loss
of neurons and synapses, in which microglia activation and neuroinﬂammation are cru-
cial [7,8]. At ﬁrst, the acute neuroinﬂammatory response helps with Aβ-clearance, but the
continuous microglial activation leads to a neurotoxic pathway [71]. In post-mortem AD
brains, Aβ-plaques, NFTs, and brain atrophy can be observed with accentuation in the
temporal lobe (including hippocampus) and parietal lobe [8].

patients from Table 4. For Figures 5 and 6: The pedigree design highlights the taxonomic classiﬁcation
of the dysbiotic bacteria. Light green cells stand for an increase and the light red cells for a decrease,
respectively. Signiﬁcant changes are shown in bold letters (p < 0.05). White cells indicate that no
changes were reported or, in the case of Biﬁdobacterium, both signiﬁcant increases and decreases were
found. The last two columns contain additional, non-exhaustive information on how the bacteria are

thought to impact the pathogenesis. The second last column to the right depicts bacterial molec-
ular factors, which may be components of the bacteria or bacterial metabolites. Finally, the last
column lists possible mechanisms by which these molecular factors may interfere with disease de-
velopment. The colours summarise factors or mechanisms that are repetitive. Bacterial production
or involvement in the metabolism of GABA (light blue, [18,20,66]), tryptophan (turquoise, [66]),
acetylcholine (emerald colour, [18,20]), noradrenaline (light yellow, [18,20]), phenylalanine (dark
orange, [27]), and 5-HT (salmon colour, [18,20]) may lead to an imbalance in central nervous sys-
tem neurotransmitters (yellow). Clostridium perfringens synthesises various exotoxins harming
the intestinal epithelium lining and causing GI inﬂammation (brown) [65]. Biﬁdobacterium spp.
produces folate, which contributes to changes in DNA methylation [61]. Gram-negative bacteria’s
cell wall containing LPS (light purple) can stimulate TLRs located on immune cells (lilac, [21,31]).
TLR-mediated immune activation is eventually leading to systemic inﬂammation, BBB disturbance,
and neuroinﬂammation [14]. SCFAs deriving from bacteria are involved in microglia maturation
and activation, BDNF-production, tight junction regulation in the gut barrier as well as in the BBB,
epigenetic and inﬂammatory processes (light orange, [18,20,26,29,67–69]). If the involvement of the
bacterial strain in the disease pathogenesis remains elusive, the last two columns are labelled as
unknown, respectively. 5-HT = serotonin; BBB = blood–brain barrier; BDNF = brain-derived neu-
rotrophic factor; GABA = gamma-Aminobutyric acid; GI = gastrointestinal; LPS = lipopolysaccharide;
NE = noradrenaline; SCFA = short-chain fatty acid; TLR = Toll-like receptor.
Increasing evidence shows that the gut microbiota may be contributing to the patho-
genesis of AD. As we age, our microbiome undergoes fundamental changes. In the elderly,
a decrease in microbial diversity could be found, and they host more pro-inﬂammatory
bacteria and less anti-inﬂammatory bacteria (Bacteroidetes, Biﬁdobacteria, Lactobacillus). Ad-
ditionally, SCFA-producing bacteria species were found to be less abundant in the elderly.
Decreased SCFA levels are thought to facilitate activation of microglial cells by inducing
inﬂammatory processes, ﬁrst on the gut leading to a leaky gut, but also on a systemic
level, including the brain, as the inﬂammation signalling molecules spread throughout the
body. In fact, elevated levels of circulating pro-inﬂammatory cytokines were found in AD
patients [70,72–76]. This, in turn, also affects the permeability of the BBB [70,71,74,76]. The
interrupted BBB facilitates neuroinﬂammation in the brain and neuronal death, as seen in
AD [70,74].
Further, the gut microbiota is a source of amyloid proteins. Many bacteria strains are ca-
pable
of
producing
amyloid.
Bacillus
subtilis,
Escherichia
coli,
Mycobacterium
tuberculosis, Salmonella enterica, Salmonella typhimurium, and Staphylococcus aureus are a
few examples [29,70,76]. Those bacterial amyloids are thought to inﬂuence AD pathogene-
sis in three different ways. Firstly, they may act as an inducer of inﬂammation response
against Aβ. Even though bacterial amyloids and Aβ differ in their amino acid sequence,
they resemble each other in their folding structure. Therefore, they are recognised by the
same TLRs [29,74–76]. TLR activation triggers the inﬂammatory immune response, which
in turn might lead to further neuronal amyloid production inside the brain and reinforces
the process of chronic neuroinﬂammation [74,76]. Secondly, through the concept of molecu-
lar mimicry, microbial amyloids could show a prion-like behaviour and cross-seed to the
brain, where they promote the formation and accumulation of pathogenic β-sheet structure
in other proteins, which leads to misfolded Aβ, as in AD [70,74,77]. Thirdly, an additional
hypothesis suggests that bacterial amyloids might be leaking from the gut and ﬁnd their
way to the brain, where they contribute to the brain amyloid load. However, so far, this
translocation has only been observed in animal studies with mice [70,76].
In addition to amyloids, (Gram-negative) bacteria also excrete LPS, which has easy
access to the brain in aged people with compromised gut barrier and BBB. Plasma LPS
levels of AD patients were identiﬁed to be up to three times as high as in healthy controls.
These elevated levels may contribute to low-grade chronic inﬂammation, and once LPS
comes into contact with microglia cells in the brain, neuroinﬂammation is triggered by
TLR activation [70,76]. Additionally, in AD patients, the presence of LPS, especially in the

Nutrients 2022, 14, 2661
23 of 51
hippocampus and neocortex (important centres for memory and executive function), has
been demonstrated [76,77].
The Association of gut bacteria to AD is being extensively researched, both in animal
models and AD patients. Overall, a decreased bacteria diversity within each patient (alpha
diversity) and among AD patients (beta diversity) has been observed in comparison to
healthy controls [72,76]. The most overlapping ﬁndings were an increase in the phylum
Bacteroidetes [74,76,78] and a decrease in Biﬁdobacteria and Firmicutes [74,76,77]. In general,
decreased numbers of anti-inﬂammatory bacteria (Bacillus/Bacteroides fragilis, Eubacterium
rectale, Eubacterium hallii, and Faecalibacterium prasunitzii) were detected in AD patients’
stool samples [74]. The detailed list can be seen in Table 5. The data is further visually
represented in Figure 7.
4.5. Parkinson Disease
Parkinson’s Disease (PD) is, after Alzheimer’s disease, the most prevailing neurode-
generative disease [82]. There is a strong association with age. Approximately 2–3% of
people older than 65 are affected by PD, whereas, in the general population, the prevalence
is approximately 0.3% [9]. With the increase in worldwide life expectancy, a dramatic
increase in prevalence is expected in the future [10]. PD is the most common cause of
clinical parkinsonism syndrome, which consists of brady-/hypokinesia, resting tremor,
rigidity, and postural instability [82]. In addition to these motor symptoms, there is also
a large variety of non-motor symptoms, which might occur much earlier than the motor
manifestations. Some of these non-motor symptoms are hyposmia, REM–sleep behavioural
disorder, pain, depression, and obstipation [9,10,82]. Aetiology is multifactorial. PD’s
heritability lies at 30%. Environmental and lifestyle factors are the major contributors to the
overall PD risk [10]. The modiﬁable risk-increasing factors include exposure to toxic chemi-
cals such as pesticides and head injuries. Caffeine, exercise, and nicotine, on the other hand,
seem to have a protective effect [10]. The pathologic hallmarks of PD are the degeneration
of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra located in the midbrain and intracellular
protein aggregations of misfolded α-synuclein, also known as Lewy bodies [82]. This
results in a dopamine deﬁciency in substantia nigra, a functional component of the basal
ganglia, which is instrumental for motor function [10]. Motor symptoms manifest once
50–70% of all dopaminergic neurons have been lost [10]. The tangible mechanisms by
which PD is triggered remain elusive, and the pathogenesis appears complex. Oxidative
stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, neuroinﬂammation, impaired autophagy, and protein
aggregation are shown to contribute to PD pathogenesis [10,83,84].
During the past two decades, the GI tract and the microbiome have become a major
area of research regarding PD aetiopathogenesis. Gut microbial dysbiosis and its effects on
the MGBA contribute to PD pathogenesis and progression on various pathways. Changes
in bacteria and metabolite abundance, lost gut integrity, deﬁciency in BBB, and neuroin-
ﬂammation are important players [51,84].
According to the most popular hypothesis connecting the gut and PD, the aggregation
of misfolded α-synuclein might be initiated in the ENS and further propagated to the
CNS via retrograde axonal transport, especially through the vagus nerve. Through this
cell-to-cell transmission, α-synuclein could ﬁnally reach the pars compacta of the substantia
nigra [85]. This hypothesis goes back to Braak and colleagues and is supported by the
early neuropathological detection of α-synuclein inclusions in the ENS of PD patients.
Such inclusions could be found in neurons of the submucosal and myenteric plexus, which
are part of the ENS before they could be detected in the brain [32,51]. These early ENS
aggregations could, at least partially, explain why gastrointestinal symptoms often precede
the onset of the neurological PD symptoms [29]. Animal models have further conﬁrmed the
involvement of the vagus nerve in PD pathogenesis [86]. Additionally, population-based
studies have shown that people with truncal vagotomy had a reduced risk after >5 years for
PD compared to matched controls [83–86]. It is postulated that once misfolded α-synuclein
is formed, it could act as a template for additional misfolding and lead to protein inclusions

Nutrients 2022, 14, 2661

that can spread from neuron to neuron (prion-like behaviour) [32,84,86]. Accumulating
α-synuclein forms oligomers, which can then build ﬁbrils, which can eventually turn
into Lewy bodies [32]. These protein aggregates are potent activators of microglial cells
and can therefore provoke inﬂammatory processes, resulting in neuroinﬂammation and
neurodegeneration [84,87]. Additionally, TLRs are also stimulated by α-synuclein [87].
Braak et al. suggested that unknown environment toxins or microbial pathogens may
trigger the initial protein aggregation in the gut [84–86]. Recent studies have been focusing
on the role of gut microbiota in the initiation of α-synuclein aggregation. In PD patients, an
increase in intestinal α-synuclein showed a strong correlation with microbial alterations,
which lead to inﬂammation and loss of gut integrity [85]. Additionally, the bacterial
inﬂammatory metabolite, LPS, facilitates α-synuclein accumulation and aggregations, as
well as the formation of ﬁbrils [85]. PD patients exhibit elevated levels of serum LPS and
decreased levels of LBP, which helps with the elimination of the endotoxin secreted by
Gram-negative bacteria [51,88]. Through TLRs, LPS activates the innate immune system,
including microglia cells, and leads to inﬂammation–locally, systemically, as well as in the
ENS and CNS. Eventually, this can result in a loss of dopaminergic neurons [83,85,88].

Signiﬁcant changes are shown in bold letters (p < 0.05). White cells indicate that no changes were re-
ported. The last two columns contain additional, non-exhaustive information on how the bacteria are
thought to impact the pathogenesis. The second last column to the right depicts bacterial molecular
factors, which may be components of the bacteria or bacterial metabolites. Finally, the last column lists
possible mechanisms by which these molecular factors may interfere with disease development. The
colours summarise factors or mechanisms that are repetitive. Bacterial production or involvement in
the metabolism of GABA (light blue, [18,20,70]), noradrenaline (light yellow, [18,20]), dopamine (olive
green, [18,20]), phenylalanine (dark orange, [27]), and 5-HT (salmon colour, [18,20]) may lead to an
imbalance in central nervous system neurotransmitters (yellow). Bacterial strains such as Escherichia
coli and Bacillus subtilis can synthesise bacterial amyloid proteins and are therefore potential con-
tributors to AD amyloid pathology. Bacterial amyloid may induce a (neuro-)inﬂammatory response,
trigger misfolding of neuronal proteins through molecular mimicry and cross-seeding to the brain, or
leak from the gut to the brain, where they might accumulate (light and dark blue–grey) [70,74,76,77].
Biﬁdobacterium spp. maintain the integrity of the gut barrier through their colonisation and anti-
inﬂammatory properties. Thereby they prevent toxins from entering the systemic circulation [70].
Gram-negative bacteria’s cell wall containing LPS (light purple) can stimulate TLRs located on
immune cells (lilac, [21,31]). TLR-mediated immune activation is eventually leading to systemic
inﬂammation, BBB disturbance, and neuroinﬂammation [14]. SCFAs deriving from bacteria are
involved in microglia maturation and activation, BDNF-production, tight junction regulation in the
gut barrier as well as in the BBB, epigenetic and inﬂammatory processes (light orange, [21,29,67–69]).
5-HT = serotonin; AD = Alzheimer’s disease; BBB = blood–brain barrier; BDNF = brain-derived neu-
rotrophic factor; GABA = gamma-Aminobutyric acid; LPS = lipopolysaccharide; NE = noradrenaline;
SCFA = short-chain fatty acid; TLR = Toll-like receptor.
SCFAs are also relevant for PD pathogenesis. In multiple clinical studies, faecal
samples of PD patients generally contained a reduced amount of SCFAs compared to
healthy individuals [29,51]. This reduction is consistent with the lower abundance of
SCFA-producing bacteria (including Bacteroides, Blautia, Coprococcus, Faecalibacterium
prausnitzii, Lachnospiraceae, and Roseburia) in PD patients [29,51,84,85]. SCFA deﬁcien-
cies may lead to intestinal and neuronal inﬂammation, gut leakage, microglial activation,
and also Lewy body formation in the ENS, which are all important factors in PD pathogen-
esis [83–85].
Both intestinal inﬂammation and increased gut permeability could be observed in
PD patients [84]. Speciﬁc alterations of gut bacteria in PD patients lead to increased
gut permeability accompanied by intestinal inﬂammation and neuroinﬂammation [87].
In colonic biopsies, PD patients expressed a higher level of pro-inﬂammatory cytokines
such as IF-γ, IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α, as well as glial cell markers such as GFAP and
Sox-10. Furthermore, stool samples of PD patients also measured elevated cytokines
and chemokines [85]. A marker for the impaired gut barrier, the tight junction-associated
cytoplasmatic protein zonulin, was signiﬁcantly elevated in faecal samples of a case–control
study on PD patients [86]. Moreover, the elevated LPS and reduced LBP in patients’ serum
suggested increased gut permeability [83]. Endotoxins such as LPS and microbes can
enter the gut lumen and circulation and induce inﬂammation and oxidative stress, which
supports the formation of ENS and CNS synucleinopathy after activating enteric neurons
and glia cells [10,84,87]. This is supported by reports of increased expression of TLR4, a
receptor for LPS, in the colon of PD patients [84]. Systemic inﬂammation can be observed
through increased pro-inﬂammatory cytokine levels and is tearing down the integrity
of the BBB. Subsequently, pro-inﬂammatory factors gain access to the brain, where they
create a molecular environment for neuroinﬂammation and neuronal death [83–85,87].
As a consequence, CNS microglial cellsare overactivated. That seemingly affects the
dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta [83,87]. In fact, in the post-
mortem midbrains of PD patients, a higher number of immune T-cells could be found,
which are suggested to be involved in neuronal death after recognising certain antigen
epitopes on α-synuclein molecules [83].

Due to these different intertwined pathways, the gut and its microbes are considered
predisposing factors for PD pathogenesis [85]. The question remains which changes in
microbiome composition are in common among PD patients. Emerging literature has
shown some general features and trends of PD microbiomes, although the variety in
research ﬁndings is wide. The inconsistencies across different studies could be explained by
differences in methodology, geography, age, diet, and cross-sectional study design [83,84].
In general, the bacterial phenotype is shifted towards a pro-inﬂammatory phenotype,
with a higher abundance of bacteria of the genus Ralstonia. Conversely, bacteria with
anti-inﬂammatory properties such as genera Blautia, Coprococcus, Faecalibacterium, and
Roseburia were found in lower quantities in PD patients’ stool samples [51]. Overall,
genus Faecalibacterium, genus Prevotella, and family Lachnospiraceae were decreased in
PD patients compared to healthy controls. Generea Akkermansia, Biﬁdobacteriacea, and
families Christenalleaceae, Lactobacillaceae, Ruminococcaceae, and Verrucomicrobiaceae were
increased [84,86,88]. The results of the different studies are shown in Table 6, as well as in
Figures 8 and 9.

4.6. Depression
Major depressive disorder (MDD), or simply (major) depression, is a disease imposing
a tremendous health burden with a lifetime risk of 15–18%. Approximately every ﬁfth per-
son gets diagnosed with MDD at least once in life. Around the globe estimated 350 million
people are suffering from depression. In a World Health Organisation Report of 2017, major
depression was listed as the biggest contributor to worldwide disability and suicide [96].
Women are affected twice as much as men [5,97]. In most people, the ﬁrst episode of
a major depression happens between the age of 20 to 40 years. The key symptoms of
MDD are persistent sadness, loss of pleasure (anhedonia) and interest, listlessness, and low
energy levels. Additionally, a set of side symptoms such as insomnia or loss of appetite
are possible [5]. Genetic predisposition contributes one-third to MDD risk. Environmental
inﬂuences, including epigenetic mechanisms, account for the remaining two-thirds [97].
Various factors are involved in the pathogenesis of depression. Chronic stress exposure is a
well-known cause of MDD. It leads to dysregulations of the HPA-axis with elevated plasma
cortisol levels [5,97,98]. Subsequently, the body’s internal homeostasis is disrupted [97].
Moreover, changed CNS neurotransmitter levels are thought to be important contributors

to MDD pathology. Synaptic concentrations of monoamines (serotonin (5-HT), dopamine,
noradrenaline), and GABA are lower in depressive patients [97,98]. Established pharmaco-
logical therapies are also targeting these neurotransmitter imbalances [5,97]. In addition,
reduced neuroplasticity (including BDNF depletion) and chronic inﬂammation processes,
with pro-inﬂammatory cytokine and microglia involvement, are also associated with MDD
pathogenesis [97].

disease (PD) patients from Table 6. For Figures 8 and 9: The pedigree design highlights the taxonomic

acetylcholine (emerald colour, [18,20]), noradrenaline (light yellow, [18,20]), and 5-HT (salmon
colour, [18,20,83]) may lead to an imbalance in central nervous system neurotransmitters (yellow).
Streptococcus spp. can produce neurotoxins such as streptokinase and streptomycin. These neurotoxins
might irreversibly damage neurons, including dopaminergic neurons relevant for PD pathogene-
sis [51]. Roseburia spp. has anti-inﬂammatory properties since they upregulate a row of genes
involved in the innate immune response (antimicrobial peptides, TLR, intestinal barrier). A reduction
in Roseburia spp. thereby contributes to an inﬂammatory milieu [83]. Prevotella spp. are potent
producers of hydrogen sulphide (H2S). H2S can act as a neuroprotective factor, potentially also for
dopaminergic neurons relevant for PD [51,84]. Certain Escherichia spp. might affect the α-synuclein
aggregation by synthesising bacterial amyloid proteins (e.g., E. coli and curli amyloid). Bacterial
amyloid can possibly trigger an immune response and the accumulation of neuronal proteins (α-
synuclein, amyloid-β, tau) [83]. Gram-negative bacteria’s cell wall containing LPS (light purple) can
stimulate TLRs located on immune cells (lilac, [21,31]). TLR-mediated immune activation is eventu-
ally leading to systemic inflammation, BBB disturbance, and neuroinflammation [14,51]. SCFAs
deriving from bacteria are involved in microglia maturation and activation, BDNF-production,
tight junction regulation in the gut barrier as well as in the BBB, epigenetic and inflammatory
processes (light orange, [18,20,26,29,67–69,85–87,92]). If the involvement of the bacterial strain
in the disease pathogenesis remains elusive, the last two columns are labelled as unknown,
respectively. 5-HT = serotonin; BBB = blood–brain barrier; BDNF = brain-derived neurotrophic
factor; GABA = gamma-Aminobutyric acid; GI = gastrointestinal; H2S = hydrogen sulphide;
LPS = lipopolysaccharide; NE = noradrenaline; PD = Parkinson’s disease; SCFA = short-chain
fatty acid; TLR = Toll-like receptor.
Currently, several potential connections between gut microbiota and depression are
being discussed. Most human studies have been focusing on the composition of microbiota
in depressive patients. Studies of possible mechanistic pathways are relatively scarce.
Nevertheless, a few ways of interaction were identiﬁed.
In general, the taxonomic changes in bacteria were connected to a pro-inﬂammatory
state, with a reduction in anti-inﬂammatory bacteria (Faecalibacterium, Firmicutes, and
Subdoligranulum) and an increase in pro-inﬂammatory ones (Alistipes, Bacteroidetes, Eg-
gerthella, Flavonifractor, and Gammaproteobacteria). These changes go hand in hand with
metabolite alterations. Within the group of anti-inﬂammatory bacteria, SCFA-producing
bacteria were reduced (e.g., Faecalibacterium and Prevotella) [99–102]. Accordingly, faecal
samples of MDD patients contained lower levels of total SCFAs compared to healthy con-
trols [29]. SCFAs are known to have various interactions with the host’s physiology. In
the pathophysiology of depression, their inﬂuence ranges from epigenetic mechanisms
via HDAC inhibition to downregulation of pro-inﬂammatory cytokine production, vagus
nerve stimulation, microglia maturation, and BDNF production [97,99]. The neurotrophic
factor BDNF, which stimulates neurogenesis, was found to be reduced in patients with
MDD [5]. The importance of SCFAs is further supported by different clinical trials, where
after the intake of probiotics, including SCFA-producing strains, MDD patients experienced
a reduction in depressive symptoms, and healthy individuals reported improved mood
and cognition [99].
Altogether, the above-mentioned factors lead to local inﬂammation, which impairs the
gut epithelial integrity. This is followed by an increase in systemic inﬂammation [100,102].
LPS from Gram-negative bacteria could translocate and, via PAMP-activation, stimulate
microglia cells and cytokine production in depressive patients [97]. In animals, such an
inﬂammation-associated MDD model could be conﬁrmed. Intravenous LPS injections in
rats promoted depression-like behaviour [99]. Additionally, in patients with MDD, an
upregulated genetic pathway for the metabolism of LPS was found [99]. Meta-analyses
reported elevated cytokine levels in MDD patients, including IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α. The
low-grade systemic inﬂammation can also be seen in elevated levels of C-reactive protein
(CRP) [51,97,99,100]. Post-mortem studies of depressive patients’ brains found evidence
for increased microglial activation and neuroinﬂammation [5].

Furthermore, disturbances in gut microbiota are thought to affect the production of
neurotransmitters, including glutamate and tryptophan metabolism [100]. Changes in
GABA metabolism and signalling have been associated with an increased risk for depres-
sion and anxiety. In MMD patients, elevated blood levels of GABA were shown. Addition-
ally, its precursor glutamate was found in higher abundance in depressive patients [100].
A depletion in Bacteroides in MDD patients might be a contributing factor to GABA alter-
ations [100]. In the future, more studies looking into the interplay of neurotransmitters and
gut bacteria are sought to be performed.
It has become clear that stress disturbs the gut microbiome. The intraindividual α-
diversity decreases in individuals frequently exposed to stress. Moreover, the microbiota
plays a role in the function of the HPA-axis through bacteria metabolites, and stress re-
sponses can be mediated by certain bacteria strains through the vagus nerve, affecting
central nervous function [101–103].
In addition to a shift towards a pro-inﬂammatory composition as described above,
researchers trying to classify taxonomic changes in depressive patients identiﬁed the fol-
lowing trends: On the phylum level, Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Proteobacteria
were enriched, whereas Firmicutes decreased. Generally, MDD patients marked a decrease
in Coprococcus, Dialister, Escheria, Faecalibacterium, Prevotellaceae, Ruminococcus, Sutterel-
laceae, and Veillonellaceae. An increase was found in Actinomycetaceae, Alistipes, Atopium,
Blautia, Clostridium, Eggerthella, and Paraprevotella. Interestingly, for Biﬁdobacterium, the
literature was especially heterogeneous, and both increases and decreases have been
reported [99–104]. Although inconsistent ﬁndings were made, the α-diversity in MDD pa-
tients is assumingly lower [101,102]. More details on the most common bacterial alterations
in MDD patients can be found in Table 7 and in Figures 10 and 11.

4.7. Bipolar Disorder
Bipolar disorders (BD) are a group of chronic affective disorders and include bipolar
disorders I and II. BD I can be diagnosed if recurring manic episodes are present, which
may be alternating with depressive episodes. Manic symptoms should be present for a
minimum of one week and include reduced need for sleep, general disinhibition, elevated
mood, logorrhoea, grandiosity, increased conﬁdence, increased energy, and activity. The
depressive episodes fulﬁl the criteria of a major depressive episode for at least two weeks
(depressed mood, loss of interest, anhedonia, fatigue). If the diagnostic threshold for a
manic episode is not reached, the episode is classiﬁed as hypomania. Recurring hypomanic
episodes with or without depressive episodes deﬁne BD II [6,12]. Typically, BD starts
around the age of 20 years, and it has a lifetime prevalence of 2.4% [6]. BD often leads to
disability and impairs patients on a psychosocial level. Overall, BD patients’ life expectancy
is reduced by up to 10–20 years due to higher suicide rates and comorbidities such as car-
diovascular diseases [6,12]. Twin studies showed a high heritability in BD of approximately
70%, and in genome-wide association studies, various genes could be identiﬁed, which are
thought to contribute to BD pathogenesis with small effect sizes each [6,12]. The pathogen-
esis of BD remains unknown. Nevertheless, processes such as inﬂammation (elevated IL-6
levels in BD patients), increased oxidative and nitrosative stress, epigenetic mechanisms,
monoaminergic signalling, disturbance in neuronal and glial plasticity (including BDNF),
HPA-dysregulation, and mitochondrial function are associated with the development of
BD [6,12,114].
In recent years, possible interactions between BD pathogenesis and the MGBA have
been identiﬁed. Firstly, some studies observed a reduction in SCFA-producing bacteria in
BD patients’ microbiota composition. Especially butyrate-producing bacteria, including
Coproccus, Faecalibacterium, and Roseburia, were found in lower abundance. Butyrate
is thought to have a crucial impact on brain plasticity because it can stimulate BDNF
production in the CNS. Lower BDNF levels, in turn, could contribute to BD develop-
ment [115,116]. Serum levels of BDNF were lower compared to healthy controls during
depressive episodes [114].
Secondly, inﬂammation in the periphery and the CNS seems to be connected to BD
pathogenesis. In BD patients, elevated levels of inﬂammatory markers such as C-reactive
protein (CRP), IL-1, IL-6, and TNF-α were reported [12,117]. The elevation was further
accentuated during mood episodes [117,118]. There are multiple factors contributing to
this pro-inﬂammatory state: microglial activation, leaky gut, and HPA-axis activation
being three of them [117]. A leaky gut is a result of intestinal inﬂammation deriving from
pro-inﬂammatory microbiota (e.g., a reduction in Faecalibacterium and Ruminococcaceae).
As already discussed, the combination of a leaky gut and pro-inﬂammatory bacteria can
promote systemic and central inﬂammation through bacteria migration, LPS increase, TLR-
activation, and cytokine release [115–118]. As a result, the BBB permeability increases
and the inﬂammation can spread to the CNS [115]. Bipolar patients showed higher levels
of soluble CD14, which is a marker for translocating bacteria in the context of a leaky
gut [117,118]. Furthermore, changes in the tight junction proteins claudin-5 and zonulin in
BD patients are an indication of increased intestinal permeability [115]. The inﬂammatory
cytokines IL-1α, IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α, were repeatedly measured in increased amounts
in BD patients, especially during active mood episodes [115,117,118]. They stimulate the
HPA-axis and increase microglial activation in the CNS. The latter effects further contribute
to inﬂammatory processes. Ultimately, the inﬂammation shows effects on cognition and
behaviour, as it is shown that the inﬂammation mediators may inﬂuence neurotransmitter
levels (dopamine, noradrenaline, and serotonin) [117].

Figure 11. Part 2 of visual representation of the changes in microbiota composition in major depres-
sive disorder (MDD) patients from Table 7. For Figures 10 and 11: The pedigree design highlights
the taxonomic classiﬁcation of the dysbiotic bacteria. Light green cells stand for an increase and the
light red cells for a decrease, respectively. Signiﬁcant changes are shown in bold letters (p < 0.05 or
LDA values > 2). White cells indicate that no changes were reported or, in the case of Biﬁdobacterium,
both signiﬁcant increases and decreases were found. The last two columns contain additional, non-
exhaustive information on how the bacteria are thought to impact the pathogenesis. The second last
column to the right depicts bacterial molecular factors, which may be components of the bacteria or
bacterial metabolites. Finally, the last column lists possible mechanisms by which these molecular fac-
tors may interfere with disease development. The colours summarise factors or mechanisms that are
repetitive. Bacterial production or involvement in the metabolism of GABA (light blue, [18,20,100]),
acetylcholine (emerald colour, [18,20]), phenylalanine (dark orange, [27]), noradrenaline (light yel-
low, [18,20]), and 5-HT (salmon colour, [18,20]) may lead to an imbalance in central nervous sys-
tem neurotransmitters (yellow). Eggerthella spp. and Flavonifractor spp. have pro-inﬂammatory
properties (red) and are linked to inﬂammatory conditions present in MDD (brown) [100]. Addi-
tionally, Eggerthella spp. are thought to interfere with bile acid signalling pathways because certain
strains can facilitate the oxidation of bile acids, which eventually leads to disturbances in BDNF
production. BDNF has been found in lower quantities in MDD patients [99]. Some Streptococcus spp. and

Nutrients 2022, 14, 2661
37 of 51
Clostridium spp. strains are potential pathogens (purple) and, therefore, contributors to the in-
ﬂammation component of MDD pathogenesis (brown) [100]. A reduction in Faecalibacterium spp.,
known for their anti-inﬂammatory properties (dark green), is also associated with inﬂammatory
mechanisms in MDD (beige) [100]. Oscillibacter spp. might interfere with GABA signalling through
their synthesis of valeric acid, which mimics the molecular structure of GABA and can bind to
GABA receptors [100]. Gram-negative bacteria’s cell wall containing LPS (light purple) can stim-
ulate TLRs located on immune cells (lilac, [21,31,99]). TLR-mediated immune activation is even-
tually leading to systemic inﬂammation, BBB disturbance, and neuroinﬂammation [14]. SCFAs
deriving from bacteria are involved in microglia maturation and activation, BDNF-production,
tight junction regulation in the gut barrier as well as in the BBB, epigenetic and inﬂammatory
processes (light orange, [18,20,26,29,67–69,99–102,104]). If the involvement of the bacterial strain
in the disease pathogenesis remains elusive, the last two columns are labelled as unknown,
respectively. 5-HT = serotonin; BBB = blood–brain barrier; BDNF = brain-derived neurotrophic factor;
GABA = gamma-Aminobutyric acid; GI = gastrointestinal; LPS = lipopolysaccharide; MDD = major
depressive disorder; NE = noradrenaline; SCFA = short-chain fatty acid; TLR = Toll-like receptor.
Microglia cells are involved in synaptic pruning, deﬁned by processes of synapse
elimination that occur between early childhood and the onset of puberty. The gut mi-
crobiota can interfere in this process. Hence, the function of neuronal circuits might be
changed. In bipolar patients, abnormal neuronal connectivity in the limbic and prefrontal
cortex could be identiﬁed, which originate from dysfunctional pruning processes during
development [115].
Analyses of bipolar patients’ microbiota were performed, trying to map characteristic
differences in microbial communities. Among the heterogeneous results, some trends could
be identiﬁed. Most studies agreed on a decrease in α-diversity in comparison to healthy
controls [116,118]. BD individuals harboured a decreased amount of Faecalibacterium, a
Gram-positive bacterium showing anti-inﬂammatory properties [118]. Researchers also
measured an increase in the phyla Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria, the genus Bacteroides,
as well as a reduction of Coprococcus and Rumicococcaceae [102,115,116,118]. The results can
be found in Table 8, as well as in Figures 12 and 13.

Figure 13. Part 2 of visual representation of the changes in microbiota composition in bipolar
disorder (BD) patients from Table 8. For Figures 12 and 13: The pedigree design highlights the
taxonomic classiﬁcation of the dysbiotic bacteria. Light green cells stand for an increase and the
light red cells for a decrease, respectively. Signiﬁcant changes are shown in bold letters (p < 0.05
or LDA values > 2). White cells indicate that no changes were reported or, in the case of phylum
Bacteroidetes and genus Bacteroides, both signiﬁcant increases and decreases were found. The last
two columns contain additional, non-exhaustive information on how the bacteria are thought to
impact the pathogenesis. The second last column to the right depicts bacterial molecular factors,
which may be components of the bacteria or bacterial metabolites. Finally, the last column lists
possible mechanisms by which these molecular factors may interfere with disease development. The
colours summarise factors or mechanisms that are repetitive. Bacterial production or involvement
in the metabolism of GABA (light blue, [18,20]), noradrenaline (light yellow, [18,20]), phenylalanine
(dark orange, [27]), and 5-HT (salmon colour, [18,20]) may lead to an imbalance in central nervous
system neurotransmitters (yellow) [100]. A reduction in Faecalibacterium spp., known for their
anti-inﬂammatory properties (dark green), is associated with inﬂammatory mechanisms in BD
(beige) [115,116,118]. Flavonifractor spp. can break down the ﬂavonoid quercetin. Flavonoids are
polyphenols and secondary metabolites of plants. They are known for their anti-inﬂammatory and
antioxidant effects. The breakdown of quercetin through Flavonifractor could contribute to increasing
oxidative stress and inﬂammation [115]. Gram-negative bacteria’s cell wall containing LPS (light
purple) can stimulate TLRs located on immune cells (lilac, [21,31]). TLR-mediated immune activation
is eventually leading to systemic inflammation, BBB disturbance, and neuroinflammation [14].

SCFAs deriving from bacteria are involved in microglia maturation and activation, BDNF-production,
tight junction regulation in the gut barrier as well as in the BBB, epigenetic and inﬂammatory pro-
cesses (light orange, [18,20,26,29,67–69,115,116]). If the involvement of the bacterial strain in the
disease pathogenesis remains elusive, the last two columns are labelled as unknown, respectively.

5. Discussion
Numerous studies have been performed on individual diseases trying to link the
MGBA to the respective pathologies. In this paper, we analysed the characteristic changes
in colonic bacteria and their metabolites overlapping between the selected neuropsychiatric
disorders or within a certain patient subgroup. The seven diseases included can be split up
into the following subgroups: (i) neurodevelopmental disorders (ADHD and ASD), (ii) neu-
rodegenerative disorders (AD and PD), and (iii) psychiatric disorders (schizophrenia),
(iv) affective disorders (MDD and BD).
Dysbiosis was a characteristic of all seven diseases discussed. However, research
results appear heterogeneous. Quite often, the results of one paper are contradictory to the
ﬁndings of another. Thus, general statements about pathologic changes in the microbiota
are difﬁcult to make. In the future, further studies are needed to clarify the controversial
data. Nevertheless, as summarised in Tables 2–8, some changes seem to be overlapping
(see Table 9).
On the phylum level, Actinobacteria are increased in all diseases except AD, where a
decrease was reported. Anti-inﬂammatory phylum Firmicutes is also decreased in most
pathologies. For the pro-inﬂammatory phylum Bacteroidetes, the results were heteroge-
neous, with a trend towards a general increase. Since many classes of bacteria with contrary
characteristics are subordinated to one phylum, unambiguous results on the phylum level
are scarce.
On the genus level, the shift towards a pro-inﬂammatory gut microbiome becomes es-
pecially clear. Pro-inﬂammatory genera Alistipes, Eggerthella, and Flavonifractor, are generally
more abundant, whereas anti-inflammatory genera are less present (Bifidobacterium, Coprococcus,
Eubacterium, Faecalibacterium, Lactobacillus, Prevotella, Roseburia). The anti-inﬂammatory
species
Faecalibacterium
prasunitzii
and
Eubacterium
rectale
are
also
reduced [51,70,71,74,76,99–102,115,117,118].
Another common pattern among the seven diseases is the involvement of SCFAs. Their
overall role in (patho)physiology of brain diseases seems to be beneﬁcial, meaning that the
relative absence of SCFAs contributes to disease development and progression [21,29]. In
our literature review, SCFA alterations were described as a potential driver for the pathogen-
esis in all seven diseases. Their mode of interaction is broad and ranges from tight junction
modulation to anti-inﬂammatory effects, epigenetic mechanisms (HDAC), regulation of
microglia maturation, and inﬂuence on BDNF and neurotransmitter production [26,68,122].
The question arises whether some SCFAs have a more pivotal role than others and
whether certain bacteria alterations can be associated with those SCFA changes. Despite
often generalised statements regarding SCFA levels, a more detailed breakdown could be
identiﬁed for most diseases (Table 10). Especially for ADHD, BD, and schizophrenia, the
available data is sparse, calling for additional future studies to close this information gap.

SCFAs are mainly produced through the fermentation of carbohydrates such as re-
sistant starch and dietary ﬁbres. In much smaller amounts, SCFA production might also
be generated from amino acid fermentation [69]. The level and type of SCFA produced
highly depend on the daily ﬁbre intake as well as on the bacterial colonisation in the large
intestine [68]. For acetate production, the bacteria are not highly specialised, and many
bacteria strains, including Akkermansia muciniphila, Bacteroides spp., Bacteroidetes, Biﬁ-
dobacterium spp., Lactobacillus spp., Prevotella spp., Ruminococcus spp., and Streptococcus spp.,
are potent acetate producers [29,67,69]. In contrast, butyrate and propionate, for example,
can only be produced by a relatively small number of different bacteria [69]. For propi-
onate synthesis, Akkermansia municiphilla, Bacteroides spp., Bacteroidetes, Dialister spp.,
Firmicutes, and Veillonella spp., are crucial [67–69]. Anaerostipes, Clostridium butyricum,
Coprococcus, Eubacterium, Eubacterium hallii, Eubacterium rectale, Faecalibacterium praus-
nitzii, Firmicutes, Lachnospiraceae, Roseburia spp., and Ruminococcus bromii are important
players in butyrate production [21,29,67–69].
Human studies of BD patients revealed lower levels of butyrate, which was consistent
with the microbiota analysis of reduced butyrate-producing bacteria (Coproccus, Faecal-
ibacterium, Roseburia) [115,116]. As outlined in Tables 9 and 10, it is tempting to conclude
that in PD, a deﬁciency in Coprococcus, Faecalibacterium, Lachnospiraceae, and Roseburia
could be associated with a decrease in butyrate. A reduction of the phylum Firmicutes
in MDD might be corresponding to the lower levels of acetate in depressive patients. Re-
duced levels of propionate in MDD patients might be caused by a decrease in Dialister
and Coprococcus. In AD, reduced amounts of Eubacterium rectale and Faecalibacterium
prausnitzii could explain lower butyrate levels. Decreased levels of butyrate in ASD could
be explained by a reduction in butyrate-producing Eubacterium.
Regarding the disorder subgroups, hardly any clear conclusions can be drawn, except
that the changes in colon bacteria in MDD and BD are mostly congruent. Since depressive
episodes are part of the BD, these matching results could be expected and may point to
a common role of gut microbiota in both pathologies. A comparison between the two
neurodegenerative diseases, AD and PD, is not quite feasible as the bacteria analysed only
partly overlap. The same applies to the neurodevelopmental disorders ADHD and ASD.
When comparing the seven diseases on the level of bacterial metabolites, a general
decrease in SCFAs can be seen. Only in ASD and schizophrenia does there seems to be
an increase in overall SCFAs. Because of missing data, it is considerably difﬁcult to make
a comparison between the disease subgroups. Furthermore, there are certain technical
limitations to the data. In different studies, SCFA levels were measured in blood serum

Nutrients 2022, 14, 2661
44 of 51
or plasma, faeces, or urine, which makes a direct comparison of the ﬁndings harder [29].
Moreover, faecal SCFA measurements only reﬂect the part of SCFAs that has not been
absorbed. However, it is the absorbed fraction of SCFAs that holds the biological interaction
potential with human physiology [26,69]. Additionally, we have seen the large dependence
of SCFA production on certain bacteria strains. Furthermore, several other confounding
factors in study design (e.g., age, diet, geography, physical activity, medication) make a
direct comparison between the studies a challenging task [14,21].
For other bacterial metabolites such as tyrosine, tryptophan, GABA, or 5-HT, no such
consistent patterns as in SCFAs could be identiﬁed. Glutamate excess was reported in
autism spectrum disorder, schizophrenia, and major depressive disorder [44,45,65,66,100].
Reduced glutamate levels contribute to cognitive impairment in AD [126]. Glutamate
is known as the main excitatory neurotransmitter in the CNS and acts as a neuroactive
communication molecule within the MGBA with involvements in memory and learning
processes, ENS sensitivity, and motility [127]. The exact mechanism, however, by which gut
bacteria act upon glutamate levels in humans remains unclear. Corynebacterium as well as
Lactobacillus strains (Lactobacillus paracasei, Lactobacillus plantarum) have been associated
with glutamate production [126,127]. Glutamate produced by gut bacteria might interfere
with glutamate signalling in pathologies such as AD [126]. Furthermore, gut bacteria may
be involved in glutamate modulation. In ASD, lower abundances of Campylobacter jejuni
strains have been associated with alterations in glutamate metabolism since Campylobacter
jejuni might activate glutamate synthesis [126].
Together, the pro-inﬂammatory bacterial shift and decrease in SCFA may lead to a dis-
ruption of the intestinal immune and metabolic homeostasis and local inﬂammation, which
can expand throughout the entire body, eventually reaching the brain. First, reduced levels
of SCFAs and dysbiosis loosen the gut barrier, enabling bacteria to translocate. LPS from
Gram-negative bacteria gain access to the systemic circulation and activate the immune
pathway of the MGBA via TLRs [14,18,21,26,29,31]. LPS and their recognition through the
immune system are involved in all seven diseases. Moreover, higher levels of circulating
LPS were measured in ASD [44,45], schizophrenia [62], AD [70], and PD [83]. The thereby
triggered inﬂammation response is manifested in all seven diseases with increased levels
of pro-inﬂammatory cytokines, such as IL-1, IL-6, and TNF-α. The primarily local inﬂam-
mation can spread to a systemic level, which can compromise the BBB integrity. Finally,
the same pro-inﬂammatory molecules can reach the brain and induce neuroinﬂammation
and neuronal death [18,26,29,43,45,47]. Within this central inﬂammation process, CNS
microglia cells are important actors. These residing innate immune cells belong to the
macrophage group and may be activated through different mechanisms [128]. Prevalent
activating stimuli across the seven diseases of interest are: (i) direct activation through
LPS–TLR interaction inside the brain (especially TLR4) [128], (ii) activation through pro-
inﬂammatory cytokines [129], and (iii) facilitated activation and changed maturation due to
the absence of SCFAs [68,122]. In AD and PD, resting microglia can be activated through an
additional pathological stimulus. The aberrant proteins amyloid-β in AD and α-synuclein
in PD are potent inducers of a classical microglial activation [128].
The seven diseases seem to share a ﬁnal common pathway with excessively active
microglial cells [130], chronic neuroinﬂammation, and the consequent neuronal death.
Depending on where in the brain the inﬂammation happens and which cells are affected,
patients may present different symptoms, affecting mood, cognition, and behaviour. There-
fore, all the diseases discussed could be summarised as nervous inﬂammatory diseases,
where the MGBA markedly contributes to the disease development and progression [68].
Our review has several limitations. The unavailability of raw data did not allow us
to verify the results ourselves. Furthermore, not all the reviewed research papers were
of the same quality: Different sample sizes, unbalanced age- and sex-matched sample
populations, and methodological heterogeneity of analysis and sample collection made it at
times difﬁcult to directly compare the ﬁndings of the studies. Age [14,15] and sex [131,132]
are known to inﬂuence the microbiota population. In particular, the effect of sex hormones

Nutrients 2022, 14, 2661
45 of 51
on the gut microbiota has been extensively researched in recent years [132]. Although these
inﬂuences are apparent, some reviewed studies did not fully take them into account by
either including only one sex or using unmatched controls. In other studies, the groups
were fully matched for sex and age, but in the analysis, gender-driven differences were not
further looked into. Therefore, we cannot draw any conclusions on sex-speciﬁc changes in
relation to the investigated diseases. Other confounding factors which have an inﬂuence
on the microbiome composition, such as differences in diet and lifestyle behaviour, were
not respected in all the studies analysed.
6. Conclusions and Future Prospects
In this paper, we attempted to outline overlapping colon microbiota features in patients
suffering from different neurodevelopmental, neuropsychiatric, and neurodegenerative
diseases (attention deﬁcit hyperactivity disorder, autism spectrum disorder, schizophrenia,
Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, major depressive disorder, and bipolar disorder).
We have reported that the microbiota–gut–brain axis contributes to the pathophysiology
of all these diseases. A consistent feature observed in all seven diseases studied is a shift
towards an inﬂammatory gut microbiome phenotype containing more pro-inﬂammatory
and less anti-inﬂammatory bacteria strains. The changes on a more detailed level hardly
overlap, and results were sometimes contradictory due to confounding factors in the study
designs. Future standardised studies will be urgently needed to clarify bacterial changes on
lower taxonomic levels and their exact roles in the pathophysiology of these diseases. This
will help to establish potential biomarkers for early disease diagnosis. Among the various
bacterial metabolites, we highlighted the important role of SCFAs in disease pathogenesis.
SCFAs were decreased in most diseases discussed, which is generally associated with a
negative effect on the host.
In conclusion, the pathological hallmark underlying the pathophysiology of all dis-
cussed diseases is a neuroinﬂammatory process leading to neuronal cell death. The identi-
ﬁed microbiota-gut-brain-axis interactions, including altered SCFA production, are strongly
associated with the observed microglia-associated inﬂammation. We, therefore, propose
that these seven diseases can be subsumed under neuroinﬂammatory diseases.
In the future, the knowledge about microbiome–brain interactions could be used for
new treatment approaches. So far, few clinical studies have been performed, experimenting
with treatment options ranging from faecal microbiota transplant (FMT) to probiotic sup-
plementation and change of diet. They all have the goal of enhancing useful bacteria strains
and reducing the number of harmful bacteria, respectively. Further research is needed to
explore the interdependencies between intestinal microbiota and disease pathogenesis to
incorporate these novel treatment approaches into clinical practice.
