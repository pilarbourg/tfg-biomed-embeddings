Abstract
Background  Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is the most common hereditary kidney disorder 
characterized by progressive renal cyst formation, often leading to end-stage kidney disease (ESKD). In contrast to the uri­
nary metabolome in ADPKD, the composition of renal cyst fluid remains largely unexplored.
Methods  We conducted a comprehensive metabolomic analysis of renal cyst fluid from 26 ADPKD patients (20 on dialysis, 
six with kidney transplants) using ¹H-NMR spectroscopy and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). Cysts 
were clustered based on metabolite profiles, and differences were analyzed across groups defined by renal function status 
(dialysis vs. transplant), cyst volume, and cyst fluid sodium concentrations.
Results  Dialysis patients and transplant recipients differed significantly in their renal cyst fluid metabolomes. The former 
exhibited higher concentrations of myoinositol, creatinine, sucrose, τ-methylhistidine, trigonelline, and sarcosine, while the 
latter showed increased levels of leucine, isoleucine, valine and alanine. Remarkably, metabolites of the immunosuppressive 
prodrug mycophenolate mofetil were detected in renal cyst fluids after kidney transplantation. Despite intra- and interindi­
vidual variability, cyst fluid from the same patient displayed greater homogeneity. Interestingly, metabolomic profiles were 
not altered by cyst size.
Conclusion  This first systematic metabolomic analysis of renal cyst fluid in advanced ADPKD reveals distinct metabolic 
signatures linked to renal function status. The data provides novel insights into the pathophysiology of ADPKD and highlight 
the potentials of renal cyst fluid metabolomics for identifying biomarkers and therapeutic targets.

1  Background
Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD), 
one of the most frequent human monogenic disorders and 
the fourth leading cause for kidney failure worldwide, is 
characterized by the progressive development of numerous 
fluid-filled cysts within the renal parenchyma (Chapman et 
al., 2015; Harris & Torres, 2009). ADPKD is predominantly 
caused by mutations in the PKD1 or PKD2 gene encoding 
for polycystin-1 and polycystin-2. Both proteins are integral 
to the function of renal tubular epithelial cells and the main­
tenance of normal tubular architecture and function (Tor­
res et al., 2007a; Wilson, 2004). In ADPKD, formation and 
expansion of cysts are both driven by a complex interplay of 
genetic, molecular, and cellular mechanisms. Cyst initiation 
often starts early in life and involves focal dedifferentiation 
and proliferation of tubular epithelial cells derived from 
nephrons and collecting tubules, followed by fluid secretion 
into the cyst lumen (Grantham et al., 2011; Paul & Van­
den Heuvel, 2014; Torres et al., 2007a). Cyst formation and 
growth are accompanied by inflammation and fibrosis of the 
surrounding parenchyma (Fragiadaki et al., 2020). Common 
clinical symptoms of ADPKD are abdominal pain, urinary 
tract infections, hematuria, hypertension, and eventually 
renal failure (Cornec-Le Gall et al., 2019; Gaur et al., 2019). 
Half of patients reach end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) by 
age 60 requiring some method of renal replacement therapy. 
Hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis are both appropriate 
options, kidney transplantation remains the preferred choice 
if possible (Al Khunaizi & Alam, 2018).
A key aspect of ADPKD pathology is the complex com­
position of the renal cyst fluid and its paracrine cystogenic 
effects. Cyst fluid contains more than 350 unique proteins 
and other biochemically active substances (Kenter et al., 
2019; Lai et al., 2008), including products of systemic 
and local metabolism. These molecules may play critical 
roles in cyst growth, maintenance and structural forma­
tion, and disease progression (Kenter et al., 2019; Ye et al., 
1992; Yamaguchi et al., 1995). During the early stages of 
ADPKD, cysts are attached to their parental renal tubule. 
Beyond a diameter of 2 mm, cysts close off. Therefore, cyst 
fluid initially is derived from the glomerular filtrate, and in 
later stages from a combination of plasma ultrafiltration and 
secretory activity of the cyst-lining epithelium (Grantham 
et al., 2011; Paul & Vanden Heuvel, 2014; Sullivan et al., 
1998; Terryn et al., 2011).
Understanding the detailed metabolomic landscape 
of renal cyst fluid and its interactions with cyst epithelial 
cells may offer valuable insights into potential therapeutic 
strategies for ADPKD. While the urinary metabolome in 
ADPKD has been extensively studied (Dekker et al., 2020, 
2022; Gronwald et al., 2011; Hallows et al., 2023; Houske 
et al., 2023), this is the first systematic analysis of renal cyst 
fluid in advanced-stage ADPKD post-nephrectomy, includ­
ing 20 dialysis patients and six kidney transplant recipients. 
Employing proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H-NMR) 
spectroscopy and ultra-performance liquid chromatography 
(UPLC) hyphenated to a quadrupole time-of-flight mass 
spectrometry (qTOFMS) system together with state-of-
the-art data analysis, we seek to gain new insights into the 
potential pathophysiological processes relevant for ADPKD 
progression.
2  Methods
2.1  Patient selection and sampling of cystic fluid
The study included ADPKD patients with ESKD that under­
went nephrectomy at the University Hospital Regensburg, 
Germany, from October 2020 until May 2024, at the Uni­
versity Hospital Erlangen, Germany, from February 2024 
until May 2024, or at the St. Elisabeth Hospital Straubing, 
Germany, from October 2023 until May 2024. After exclu­
sion of seven patients due to macroscopic contamination of 
cyst fluid with blood or pus, 26 participants remained: 20 on 
dialysis and six with kidney transplants.
Immediately after nephrectomy, renal cystic fluid was 
obtained from cysts of various size (0.5-1 mL, 1–3 mL, > 
3 mL), centrifuged and stored at -80 °C for further analysis.
2.2  1H-NMR spectroscopy, LC-MS, and sodium 
measurements
1H-NMR: NMR experiments were performed as described 
previously (Gronwald et al., 2008). In short, 400 µL of cyst 
fluid were mixed with 200 µL of 0.1 M phosphate buffer 
(pH 7.4), 50 µl of 0.75% (w) TSP-2,2,3,3-d4 in deuterium 
oxide (Sigma-Aldrich, Taufkirchen, Germany) and 10 mL 
of a 240 mM stock solution of formic acid, which served 
as an additional internal standard that, unlike TSP, does not 
bind to protein. Spectra were acquired in 5 mm tubes on 
a 600 MHz Bruker Avance III spectrometer, using a triple 
resonance (1H, 13C, 15N, 2H lock) helium cooled cryo­
probe with z-gradient. Handling of samples was done by 
an automatic Bruker SampleJet sample changer (Bruker 
Biospin GmbH, Ettlingen, Germany). Tuning and match­
ing of the probe as well as locking and shimming of the 
sample were performed automatically. One-dimensional 1H 
NMR spectra were obtained at 298 K using a Carr-Purcell-
Meiboom-Gill (CPMG) pulse-sequence with solvent signal 
suppression by presaturation during relaxation time. Spec­
tra were automatically Fourier transformed and phase and 
baseline corrected. For quantification of metabolites, NMR

spectra were analyzed by Chenomx NMR© software suite 
v. 9.0 (Chenomx Inc., Edmonton, Canada). Signal assign­
ments were additionally verified by spike-in experiments 
and a high-resolution 2D 1H-13C HSQC spectrum that was 
matched with the corresponding 2D pure compound ref­
erence spectra of the Bruker BBIOREFCODE database 
(Bruker BioSpin GmbH, Ettlingen, Germany).
LC-MS: For protein precipitation, cyst fluid samples 
were extracted with 80% methanol. Untargeted metabo­
lomics was performed using a Thermo Scientific Dionex 
Ultimate 3000 UPLC system (Idstein, Germany) coupled 
to a SCIEX Triple TOF 5600 + mass spectrometer (Sciex, 
Framingham, Massachusetts, USA). Chromatographic sep­
aration was carried out using an ACQUITY Premier HSS 
T3 reversed phase column with VanGuard FIT (Waters, 
1.8 μm, 2.1 mm x 150 mm). For data evaluation, raw data 
files were converted into.mzml-file format using the peak 
picking function in MSConvert (version 3.0.19, ProteoW­
izard, Palo Alto, CA, USA) with the parameter “vendor” 
(Chambers et al., 2012). Untargeted data processing with 
peak detection, deconvolution, peak alignment, and gap fill­
ing was performed with MZmine2 version 2.53 (Pluskal et 
al., 2010). A detailed description of the method is given in 
the supplementary material.
Sodium measurements: Sodium measurements in 
ADPKD cyst fluid were performed at the Institute of Clini­
cal Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine at the University 
Hospital Regensburg using an indirect ion-selective elec­
trode method on a cobas® pro analyzer from Roche Diag­
nostics GmbH (Mannheim, Germany). If the original cyst 
fluid volume was insufficient due to the small size of the 
cysts, specimens from the 1H-NMR measurements were 
used. An aliquot of 340 µL of water was added to all 1H-
NMR measurement samples to achieve a final volume of 
1 mL.
2.3  Data analysis
Quantitative NMR and MS-fingerprinting data were PQN-
normalized (Dieterle et al., 2006) to account for unwanted 
technical and biological variance. The MS-fingerprinting 
data was additionally log-scaled. For clustering, missing 
values in the NMR dataset were imputed using the lowest 
concentration determined for that molecule and all measure­
ments were standardized using z-scores. The resulting data 
was hierarchically clustered for both samples and features 
by performing average linkage according to their cosine dis­
tances using SciPy (Virtanen et al., 2020). By using these 
linkages, the data was visualized through the clustermap 
function of Seaborn (Waskom, 2021). Additionally, dimen­
sion reduction and visualization with UMAP (McInnes & 
Healy, 2018) was performed.
We considered three groupings of the cyst samples to 
detect differences in fluid composition, namely patients’ 
renal function (either requiring dialysis or having a func­
tioning renal allograft), volume of the cyst (small: vol­
ume < 1 mL, medium: 1–3 mL, or large: > 3 mL), and 
sodium level of the cyst fluid (low: < 100 mmol/L or high: 
> 100 mmol/L). For the grouping based on renal function, 
differences in molecule measurements were tested using the 
Mann-Whitney U rank tests. Here we considered for each 
patient the median of the measurements from their cysts and 
assumed sample independence. Additionally, properties of 
the patients, grouped according to renal function, were com­
pared using the Mann-Whitney U rank test if numerical and 
Fisher’s exact test if binary. For these tests, the implementa­
tions in SciPy (Virtanen et al., 2020) were used.
For the comparisons of molecules based on volume and 
sodium level of the cysts, a Linear Mixed Effects Model 
was used to account for differences between patients, using 
MixedLM from Python package statsmodels (Seabold & 
Perktold, 2010).
3  Results
3.1  Patient characteristics
26 advanced-stage ADPKD patients who underwent a 
nephrectomy were included. 20 patients were currently on 
renal dialysis and six had received a kidney allograft 12 to 
60 months ago subsequent to years on dialysis. The mean 
age of the entire cohort at ADPKD diagnosis was 25.8 ± 8.2 
years. Mean age at first dialysis and time of nephrectomy 
was 47.8 ± 8.9 years and 53.8 ± 8.0 years, respectively. In 
most cases, nephrectomy was performed due to a lack of 
space before kidney transplantation. Other indications for 
nephrectomy comprised abdominal pain and indigestion, 
recurrent infections, hematuria/hemorrhage, and suspicion 
of malignancy. Weight of removed organs ranged from 779 
up to 5,800 g. Detailed patient characteristics are summa­
rized in Table 1, their medication in Supplementary Table 2.
Given are the absolute number and percentage or mean 
value and standard deviation. The last column contains the 
p-value as calculated using the Mann-Whitney U rank test 
for numerical data and Fisher’s exact test for binary data. 
* Age at time of diagnosis could not be evaluated in two 
cases, so mean value, standard deviation and p-value were 
calculated using the remaining 24 cases.
3.2  Metabolite composition of renal cystic fluid
To analyze the metabolite composition of renal cystic fluid, 
1H-NMR spectroscopy (in total 61 cysts from 26 patients) 
1 3

S. Heckscher et al.
and LC-MS (in total 46 cysts from 23 patients) were con­
ducted. Numbers of specimens ranged from one to 11 per 
individual. Figure 1 shows the results of both measurement 
methods as clustered heatmaps. Note that Fig. 1A displays 
metabolites quantified by NMR, while Fig. 1B gives a broad 
metabolic overview provided by MS-fingerprinting data.
Clustering revealed two groups of cysts with respect to 
their metabolomic profile, in both NMR and MS data. These 
groups mostly align with the renal function status of the 
respective patients. Thus, we will be considering the cysts 
from transplant patients (called “transplant group”) and 
dialysis patients (“dialysis group”) in their place from now 
on. Also, the molecules appear to form two clusters, which 
are highlighted as “molecule group 1” and “molecule group 
2”. From Fig. 1 it becomes apparent that cyst fluids of the 
dialysis group tend to reveal higher values for molecules in 
group 1, and lower values for molecules in group 2, whereas 
this trend is reversed in the transplant group.
For NMR data, testing for differences between the dialy­
sis and the transplant group identified ten metabolites that 
differed significantly in distribution (see Supplementary Fig. 
S1). Six of those compounds trended to have higher con­
centrations in cysts from dialysis than transplant patients. 
Those are myoinositol (Bonferroni-corrected p-value 
2.9 × 10− 4), creatinine (2.9 × 10− 4), sucrose (5.7 × 10− 4), 
τ-methylhistidine (8.6 × 10− 3), trigonelline (1.8 × 10− 2), and 
sarcosine (3.6 × 10− 2). Their concentrations also vary more 
within the dialysis group than in the transplant group (see 
Supplementary Fig. S1). Except trigonelline, these mole­
cules belong to “molecule group 1”, exemplifying the trend 
observed before. In the transplant group, higher concentra­
tions were detected for alanine (p-value 2.9 × 10− 4), isoleu­
cine (3.4 × 10− 3), valine (9.7 × 10− 3), and leucine (4.8 × 10− 2). 
These belong to “molecule group 2”, together with 6 other 
proteinogenic amino acids, while only 5 proteinogenic 
amino acids belong to “molecule group 1”. Note that the 
signal assignment of the significantly regulated metabolites 
was additionally verified by spike-in experiments.
Based on the MS data, 364 features were significantly 
different between the transplant and the dialysis group as 
illustrated by the volcano plot in Supplementary Fig. S2. 
Significantly different features with p-value, log2 fold 
change, exact mass, retention time and partial identification 
with indication of the level of the ID are listed in Supple­
mentary Table 1. In accordance with the NMR data, isoleu­
cine and leucine were significantly higher in the transplant 
group. Among the ten features with the highest absolute fold 
change, two features could be assigned to glucuronides of 
mycophenolic acid. The signal at 7.6 min was identified as 
mycophenolic acid glucuronide (MPAG) using an authen­
tic standard. The signal at 6.59 min was putatively assigned 
to mycophenolic acid acyl glucuronide (AcMPAG).

readily excreted to over 90% into the urine by glomerular 
filtration and active tubular secretion, predominantly as 
MPAG (Bullingham et al., 1998).
3.3  Intraindividual and interindividual differences 
of cyst fluid composition
Both clustering (see Fig. 1) and UMAP dimension reduction 
(see Fig.  2) demonstrate that different cyst fluid samples 
Mycophenolic acid is an immunosuppressant derived from 
the prodrug mycophenolate mofetil that was given to all six 
transplant patients. Accordingly, its metabolites were only 
found in the transplant group. For data analysis, zero val­
ues present in the dialysis group were replaced by small 
imputed values and therefore the obtained p-values and fold 
changes for these two metabolites have to be treated with 
care. Mycophenolic acid undergoes phase 2 conjugation 
by the uridine diphosphate glucuronosyl transferase and is

group ranged between 26.1 and 166.5 mmol/L. The trans­
plant group featured only high-sodium cysts with concen­
trations between 132.0 and 151.9 mmol/l, i.e. within the 
physiological range for serum sodium.
Additionally, we considered differences in cyst fluid com­
position based on the sodium level. A Mixed Linear Effects 
Model was used to estimate the difference by sodium level 
while accounting for inter-patient differences. Significant 
differences were observed for pyroglutamate (Bonferroni 
corrected p-value 3.4 × 10− 17), pyruvate (2.8 × 10− 2), and tri­
methylamine N-oxide (1.0 × 10− 19) (see Fig. 4).
3.6  Total metabolite concentration of cyst fluid
Regarding the MS data, PQN (Probabilistic Quotient Nor­
malization (Dieterle et al., 2006) factors were correlated with 
the sum of all features (TIC) (see Supplementary Fig. S3). 
A PQN factor larger than 1 implies a higher overall concen­
tration in a sample in comparison to the median reference 
chromatogram, a PQN factors below 1 vice versa. Remark­
ably, the transplant group features significantly lower PQN 
factors (p = 3.67e− 7, Mann Whitney U test). Hence, the cyst 
fluids of this group revealed lower total metabolite concen­
trations on average. Furthermore, the PQN factors of the 
dialysis group scattered widely in comparison to the trans­
plant group. So, renal cyst fluids of dialysis patients revealed 
higher differences in total metabolite concentrations.
4  Discussion
The composition of renal cyst fluid has intrigued research­
ers since the initial studies conducted in the mid-20th 
century (Bricker & Patton, 1955; Lambert, 1947). Early 
from the same patient are more similar than cyst fluid sam­
ples from different patients. This is exemplified by patient 
11 (dark green in Figs. 1 and 2), whose samples form a tight 
cluster with no overlap with other patient samples in that 
group (see Fig. 2: 1H-NMR: top left corner, LC-MS: bottom 
right corner).
Additionally, UMAP visualization (see Fig.  2) under­
scores the dichotomy of the cyst metabolome of dialysis 
patients (left for 1H-NMR, right for MS) and transplant 
recipients (right for 1H-NMR, left for MS), already 
described before.
3.4  Impact of cyst volume on cyst fluid composition
Differences between cysts of different volumes (45 cysts 
from 13 patients (11 dialysis, 2 transplant)) were tested for 
both, NMR and MS measurements, using a Mixed Linear 
Effects Model. NMR measurements yielded a single sig­
nificant metabolite, namely sarcosine (Bonferroni corrected 
p-value of 2.4 × 10− 4), but this difference was driven mainly 
by one measurement for patient 2. The effect of cyst volume 
on sarcosine is not significant when excluding this measure­
ment. Among the MS data, no molecules revealed a signifi­
cant difference.
3.5  Sodium concentrations of cyst fluid
Sodium concentration was measured in 59 cyst fluid sam­
ples. 45 cysts from 23 patients yielded reliable measure­
ments (see Fig.  3). Cysts were labeled as high-sodium 
(sodium ≥ 100 mmol/L) or low-sodium (sodium < 100 
mmol/L). These labels are also shown in Fig. 1 (third col­
umn). Obviously, all low-sodium cysts were obtained from 
patients undergoing dialysis. Overall sodium values in this 
Fig. 2  UMAPs of 1H-NMR (left) and LC-MS (right) data. Mea­
surements of different cyst fluid samples from the same patient are 
depicted by the same color. Patients that had only a single cyst sampled 
and analyzed are shown in black. Renal function status is marked by 
dots (dialysis) and crosses (transplant).

S. Heckscher et al.
This study demonstrates a clear metabolic distinction 
between renal cyst fluid samples from dialysis patients and 
transplant recipients. Elevated levels of myoinositol, creati­
nine, sucrose, τ-methylhistidine, trigonelline, and sarcosine 
in dialysis patients are indicative of systemic metabolic 
derangements and altered cyst epithelial activity. In con­
trast, significantly increased concentrations of numerous 
proteinogenic amino acids in transplant recipients suggest 
restored metabolic stability and transformed conditions 
in native kidneys post-transplantation. Greater intra- and 
interindividual variability in the dialysis group compared 
to the more homogenous profiles observed in transplant 
recipients further underscores the systemic influences on 
cyst fluid composition and assumably the loss of original 
cyst epithelial features after transplantation. In both groups, 
investigations predominantly focused on electrolytes, creat­
inine, and urea (Gardner, 1969; Gardner et al., 1992; Huse­
man et al., 1980). Over the years, the complex nature of this 
biofluid has been examined from diverse perspectives (Fox­
all et al., 1992; Lai et al., 2008; Slade et al., 1998). To our 
knowledge, this study represents the first systematic metab­
olomic analysis of renal cyst fluid in an advanced-stage 
ADPKD cohort, comprising patients with ESKD that are 
either on dialysis (20 participants) or have received a kidney 
transplant previously (six participants). By leveraging high-
resolution measurement technologies and advanced statisti­
cal approaches, we identified distinct metabolic signatures 
contingent on renal function status, thereby offering novel

Metabolomic profiling of renal cyst fluid in advanced ADPKD: insights from dialysis and transplantation…
in the native ADPKD kidneys: immunosuppression, reduc­
tion in renal blood flow, abolished effect of uremia on 
tubular epithelium proliferation, and improvement of fluid 
overload may contribute to the significant decline in total 
kidney volume subsequent to transplantation (Jung et al., 
2016; Veroux et al., 2018; Yamamoto et al., 2012). Both the 
altered systemic and intrarenal conditions will significantly 
affect the transepithelial secretion and metabolic activity of 
the cyst-lining epithelium.
4.2.1  Dialysis patients
In dialysis patients, the metabolomic profile of renal cyst 
fluid demonstrated considerable heterogeneity, likely attrib­
utable to the plentiful systemic factors associated with 
chronic renal failure and its management. These include 
comorbidities such as hypertension, malnutrition, and 
hyperparathyroidism, extensive use of medication, and the 
varying impact of long-term dialysis (Broseta et al., 2022; 
Stegmayr, 2017; Tonelli et al., 2011). Furthermore, the par­
tially preserved variation of epithelial features depending 
on the cysts’ origin (Gardner, 1969; Gardner et al., 1992; 
Huseman et al., 1980) promoted the heterogeneity, which is 
especially showcased by varying sodium levels and prob­
ably by the widely scattered total metabolite concentrations.
Creatinine levels in cyst fluid were markedly elevated 
and heterogenous. On the one hand, this phenomenon 
reflects the impaired systemic clearance with oscillating 
high serum creatinine during intermittent dialysis treatment. 
On the other hand, the intraindividual variability in creati­
nine concentrations suggests residual heterogeneity of the 
cyst barrier function with the ability to accumulate creati­
nine in “distal cysts” (Gardner, 1969; Gardner et al., 1992; 
Huseman et al., 1980). Apparently, this feature is lost due to 
disease progression after transplantation. This hypothesis is 
underscored by the divergent variability of cyst creatinine 
and cyst sodium among dialysis and transplant patients.
Myoinositol, a well-established urinary biomarker of 
chronic kidney disease and, particularly, of ADPKD (Bevi­
lacqua & Bizzarri, 2018; Dekker et al., 2022; Gronwald et 
al., 2011; Gil et al., 2018) was significantly elevated in the 
cyst fluids of dialysis patients compared to those of trans­
plant recipients. In renal failure, not only urinary myo­
inositol rises but also serum myoinositol increases due to 
lower intrarenal enzymatic degradation (Bevilacqua & Biz­
zarri, 2018; Omosule et al., 2024). As cyst myoinositol of 
both groups significantly surpassed serum levels (Omosule 
et al., 2024), cyst-lining cells apparently accumulate and 
secrete myoinositol into the cyst lumina. The prominent gap 
between the dialysis and the transplant group might be pri­
marily due to the renal function and the consecutively dif­
fering serum myoinositol (Meeusen et al., 2022).
fluid samples of different cysts from one patient were more 
similar than cyst fluids from different patients. Moreover, 
minimal impact of cyst volume on metabolic profiles was 
observed, with sarcosine as a rare exception driven by a 
single outlier. These findings not only highlight systemic 
and local factors driving cyst fluid composition but also 
emphasize its potential as a biomarker source for ADPKD 
management.
4.1  ADPKD renal cyst fluid genesis
To answer, why kidney transplantation changes the metabo­
lomic profile of ADPKD renal cyst fluid in such a profound 
way, the pathophysiology of renal cyst fluid genesis has to 
be clarified. As renal cysts are regarded to be anatomically 
separated from their parental tubule segment– except in 
the very early stage with cyst diameters under 2 mm– cyst 
fluid arises from a combination of plasma ultrafiltration 
and secretory activity of the cyst-lining epithelium (Paul 
& Vanden Heuvel, 2014; Sullivan et al., 1998; Terryn et 
al., 2011). Therefore, cyst fluid composition is regarded to 
depend on the biophysical and biochemical properties of the 
cyst epithelium. This comprises the quality of cell-to-cell 
contacts, the expression of ion channels and transporters as 
well as electrochemical gradients, which consequently will 
affect transport of water and solutes into the cyst lumen. In 
addition, the high metabolic activity of the cyst-lining cells 
(Bakaj & Pocai, 2023; Haumann et al., 2020) may impact 
the formation of metabolites that contribute to cyst fluid 
composition.
Previously, ADPKD renal cysts were classified according 
to their origin: “Proximal cysts” derived from the proximal 
nephron are characterized by leaky cyst walls permeable 
to many substances. “Distal cysts” derived from the dis­
tal nephron and collecting tubule reveal a tight epithelium 
able to evoke considerable gradients between plasma and 
cyst fluid, namely for sodium (low cyst/serum ratio), cre­
atinine (high cyst/serum ratio) and numerous amino acids 
(high cyst/serum ratio) (Gardner, 1969; Gardner et al., 1992; 
Huseman et al., 1980).
4.2  Metabolic signatures of renal cyst fluid
The clear dichotomy of the metabolomic profiles between 
dialysis patients and transplant recipients underscores 
the profound influence of renal function on cyst fluid 
composition.
Naturally, the physical status of both patient groups 
diverges dramatically. Differences in organ functions, renal 
replacement therapy itself, numerous drugs, and the nutri­
tional status impact the organism (Tonelli et al., 2011). 
Moreover, renal transplantation changes the local conditions 
1 3

models, suggesting a direct impact on cyst epithelial metab­
olism (Aouad et al., 2023; Xie et al., 2022). Since those 
analyses address healthy renal tubule cells, further research 
on the effects of immunosuppressants on ADPKD cyst fluid 
metabolomes is required, for example by leveraging our 
innovative 3D in vivo model, the chorioallantoic membrane 
model (Bichlmayer et al., 2022; Schueler et al., 2024).
Remarkably, drugs or their derivatives are able to pass 
the cyst epithelium. According to our MS data, renal cyst 
fluid of allograft recipients contained glucuronides of myco­
phenolic acid, thus metabolites of the immunosuppressant 
mycophenolate mofetil regularly administered in kidney 
allograft recipients. Transport of these metabolites requires 
active transport, with organic anion transporters facilitating 
their cellular uptake, while the multidrug resistance-asso­
ciated protein 2 (MRP2) accounts for their efflux into the 
lumen of excretory organs including kidney (Patel et al., 
2013).
4.3  Limitations
Several limitations must be considered when interpreting 
this study’s results:
All participants suffered from advanced ADPKD with 
ESKD, either on dialysis or post-transplantation, which 
very likely do not reflect earlier disease. Furthermore, the 
study focused exclusively on patients undergoing nephrec­
tomy, which might introduce selection bias, as nephrectomy 
is typically reserved for specific clinical indications (see 
Table 1). Though, only nephrectomy allows for systematic 
and ethical sampling of renal cysts.
The potential co-presence of acquired renal cysts, which 
frequently form in patients with long-term chronic kidney 
disease independently of ADPKD, may have introduced 
variability in the metabolomic profiles analyzed. Due to 
nephron loss for any reason, activated proto-oncogenes and 
growth factors lead to tubular hyperplasia and acquired cyst 
formation of the remaining healthy nephrons, exclusively 
the proximal tubules (Choyke, 2000; Rahbari-Oskoui & 
O’Neill, 2017). However, given the fact that ADPKD results 
in the formation of hundreds of cysts whereas acquired cysts 
are much lower in number, it is statistically unlikely that 
a significant number of acquired cysts have been included. 
Nevertheless, since acquired and hereditary cysts cannot be 
distinguished, we defined this point as a limitation.
Extrarenal factors such as comorbidities, renal replace­
ment therapies, medication (see also Supplementary Table 
2), and nutrition could not be fully controlled and may have 
influenced the results. We did not correct for these various 
possible confounders due to the limited cohort size.
The absence of direct plasma metabolomic data limits 
the ability to correlate systemic metabolic changes with cyst 
Sucrose, the most abundant disaccharide found in plants, 
was uniquely abundant in the dialysis group, originat­
ing from medical interventions rather than dietary intake 
(Merino et al., 2019; Tasevska et al., 2005). For example, 
iron sucrose, commonly administered to address anemia 
in dialysis patients, may account for this observation. As 
human cells lack sucrose transporters, transepithelial trans­
port relies on paracellular diffusion in a somewhat perme­
able cyst epithelium (Sullivan et al., 1998).
Three further molecules, namely τ-methylhistidine, trig­
onelline, and sarcosine, are significantly increased in the 
dialysis group. All three metabolites are discussed as novel 
serum biomarkers elevated in renal failure (Liu et al., 2024; 
Santos et al., 2023; Yamaguchi et al., 2021).
4.2.2  Transplant recipients
Allograft recipients, whose transplantations date back 12 to 
60 months, displayed cyst fluid metabolomic profiles with 
significantly reduced inter- and interindividual variability 
reflecting the stabilization of systemic metabolic conditions 
and perhaps the progressive loss of typical cyst epithelial 
features post-transplantation (Jung et al., 2016; Torres et 
al., 2007b; Yamamoto et al., 2012). This assumption is sup­
ported by the consistently high cyst sodium concentrations 
similar to serum levels. However, the last observation might 
be biased by the low number of patients and cysts in the 
transplant group.
Elevated levels of proteinogenic amino acids, particularly 
leucine, isoleucine, valine, and alanine, were a hallmark of 
the transplant group. These findings suggest diminished 
intraepithelial amino acid turnover and metabolic demands 
after renal transplantation (Jung et al., 2016; Veroux et al., 
2018; Yamamoto et al., 2012). Improved nutritional status 
post-transplantation will also affect cyst amino acid content 
(Małgorzewicz et al., 2008). Interestingly, mean concen­
trations of almost all detected amino acids exceed physi­
ological serum levels in the transplant group, but not in the 
dialysis group. Glutamine represents the only amino acid 
with lower concentrations in cyst fluid than in serum in both 
the transplant and dialysis group. This may reflect the direct 
utilization of glutamine as carbon source by cyst cells (Fox­
all et al., 1992; Haumann et al., 2020).
The interplay between reduced renal perfusion, the miss­
ing pro-proliferative effects of uremia, and immunosuppres­
sive therapy, particularly with calcineurin inhibitors such as 
tacrolimus, likely contributes to these metabolic changes 
(Jung et al., 2016; Marchetti & Navalesi, 2000; Oliveras 
et al., 2024; Shrestha, 2017; Torres et al., 2007b; Thölking 
et al., 2021; Veroux et al., 2018; Yamamoto et al., 2012). 
Tacrolimus-induced alterations of intrarenal amino acid 
pathways have been documented in both in vivo and in vitro

5  Conclusion
This study provides a detailed characterization of renal cyst 
fluid metabolomics in advanced ADPKD, highlighting dis­
tinct metabolic signatures influenced by renal function sta­
tus. These findings may not only enhance our understanding 
of ADPKD pathophysiology but also underscore the clini­
cal potential of metabolomics in guiding disease manage­
ment and therapeutic development. Future investigations 
should prioritize the integration of serum metabolomics and 
expand such analyses to earlier disease stages to elucidate 
the systemic and local interplay that drives cystogenesis.

4.4  Clinical outlook and future research
The results of this study may have direct implications for 
clinical practice. The distinct metabolic signatures identi­
fied in renal cyst fluid underscore its potential as a diag­
nostic and prognostic biomarker in ADPKD. For instance, 
elevated myoinositol levels could aid in monitoring disease 
progression, while branched-chain amino acid profiles may 
provide insights into cyst epithelial activity and therapeu­
tic responses. Moreover, the stabilization of metabolomic 
profiles post-transplantation may shed light on cystogenic 
pathways that may be addressed pharmaceutically in earlier 
stages of the disease. The analysis of cyst fluid of advanced 
stages of ADPKD may be regarded as a limitation. However, 
it may reflect the maximum amplitude of metabolic disor­
ders in the course of ADPKD and, therefore, help to iden­
tify metabolic fingerprints that potentially already emerge at 
early stages of the disease and affect its progression. There­
fore, we will measure those metabolites next in plasma and 
urine of early stage ADPKD patients and correlate the find­
ings with renal function and cyst progression. Although our 
current data do not allow for causal correlations between 
cyst metabolome and cyst progression, the identified cyst 
fluid metabolites represent an excellent basis for further 
experiments to address the paracrine effects on cyst epithe­
lium, e.g. using our already mentioned 3D in vivo model 
(Bichlmayer et al., 2022; Schueler et al., 2024). Addition­
ally, exploring the impact of specific therapeutic agents, 
such as immunosuppressants, on cyst epithelial metabolism 
could provide novel insights into targeted treatment strate­
gies. Lastly, leveraging advanced imaging techniques and 
machine learning approaches to correlate metabolomic data 
with clinical outcomes could pave the way for personalized 
medicine in ADPKD management, ultimately improving 
patient care and prognosis.
