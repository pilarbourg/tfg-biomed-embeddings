ABSTRACT
Aims/Introduction: Diabetes patients develop a variety of metabolic abnormalities in
addition to hyperglycemia. However, details regarding change in various metabolites after
comprehensive diabetes treatment remain unknown. This study aimed to identify the
short-term change in metabolome in inpatients who were subject to comprehensive dia-
betes treatment, using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry-based non-target metabo-
lomics techniques.
Materials and Methods: Participants of the present study were randomly recruited
from the patients with type 2 diabetes hospitalized due to problems with glycemic con-
trol (n = 31) and volunteers without diabetes (n = 30), both of whom were aged
between 20 and 75 years. A metabolomic analysis of fasting plasma samples on the 2nd
(pre-treatment) and 16th hospital (post-treatment) day with gas chromatography/mass
spectrometry using a multiple reaction monitoring mode was carried out.
Results: A principal component analysis showed that metabolome of fasting plasma
was different between individuals with and without diabetes. The metabolome of fasting
plasma in diabetes patients after treatment was different from that of pre-treatment, as
well as individuals without diabetes. Many amino acids (proline, glycine, serine, threonine,
methionine, pyroglutamic acid, glutamine and lysine) were significantly increased by >10%
after administering the inpatient diabetes treatment. A hierarchical clustering analysis
showed that in the case of patients with markedly decreased monosaccharide levels and
increased 1,5-anhydroglucitol, the levels of amino acids increased more significantly.
Conclusions: After a 2-week comprehensive treatment, the plasma levels of various
amino acids increased in conjunction with the reduction in monosaccharide levels in
poorly controlled type 2 diabetes patients.

INTRODUCTION
Diabetes mellitus, which is caused by relative or absolute deﬁ-
ciency of insulin, is a group of chronic metabolic disorders
characterized by hyperglycemia. Diabetes patients also develop
a variety of metabolic abnormalities, such as amino acid and
lipid metabolic disorders, in addition to hyperglycemia.
Metabolomics attempts to identify and quantify small mole-
cule metabolites1. Recently, improvements in the metabolomics
analytical platform have enabled the identiﬁcation of the patho-
physiology of diabetes2 and its complication3, and many clinical
studies examining patients with diabetes have been carried out.
In metabolomics studies, a variety of analytical platforms, such
as nuclear magnetic resonance, gas chromatography/mass spec-
trometry (GC/MS) and liquid chromatography/mass spectrome-
try, are used. GC/MS is a highly sensitive and speciﬁc method,
and we identiﬁed metabolites related to atherosclerosis in
patients with type 2 diabetes, using this platform4.
Several metabolomics analyses have evaluated the temporal
change in metabolism of diabetes patients5-12. Most of such
analyses were related to the long-term (several months to years)
changes brought about by a speciﬁc antidiabetic agent. Never-
theless, diabetes patients often receive not only glycemic treat-
ment, but also treatment to control other risk factors, such as
lipid level, blood pressure and bodyweight. However, details
regarding short-term change in metabolism caused by real-
world diabetes treatment, which is not limited to glycemic con-
trol, remain unknown. In the present study, we aimed to iden-
tify the short-term change in metabolism in inpatients who
were subject to comprehensive diabetes treatment, using GC/
MS-based non-target metabolomics techniques.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study population
This is a prospective observational study of diabetes patients
hospitalized due to problems with glycemic control. Participants
were randomly recruited from the patients with type 2 diabetes
who were admitted in Osaka University Hospital, Osaka, Japan,
to improve glycemic control and aged between 20 and 75 years.
Patients who did not receive intensive glycemic control, such as
those with severe retinopathy, patients with serum creatinine
>176.80 lmol/L (2.0 mg/dL), severe infection or severe trauma,
and patients in the pre- and postoperative period were
excluded. Volunteers without diabetes aged between 20 and
75 years were also recruited on the website of the Department
of Metabolic Medicine, Osaka University Graduate School of
Medicine. Overall, 33 diabetes patients and 30 adults without
diabetes were enrolled in the study during 2017 to 2019.
This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the
Osaka University Hospital, Japan (approval number: 16374),
and was carried out in accordance with the principals of the
Declaration of Helsinki and current legal regulations in Japan.
Written informed consent was obtained from all participants
after a full explanation of the study.
Study protocol
For all participants, patients’ medical history was obtained and
height was measured. Diabetes patients received a comprehen-
sive diabetes treatment, including intensive glycemic control, as
well as blood pressure, dyslipidemia and bodyweight control, in
the hospital. Fasting blood and urine samples were taken, and
vital signs and weight were measured on the 2nd and 16th hos-
pital day (hereinafter, referred to pre-treatment and post-
treatment period, respectively). For participants without dia-
betes, their fasting blood and urine samples were obtained, and
vital signs and weight were measured only once. The estimated
glomerular ﬁltration rate (mL/min 1.73 m-2) was calculated
according to the Statement of the Japanese Society of Nephrol-
ogy13. C-peptide immunoreactivity index was calculated as
100 9 C-peptide immunoreactivity (ng/mL) / fasting plasma
glucose (mg/dL)14.
Some portions of the blood samples, for metabolomics analy-
sis, were cooled in a freezer at 4C immediately after collection.
The samples were then centrifuged (3,000 g, 10 min), and
plasma was stored at -80C within 4 h.
Metabolomics measurements
A metabolomic analysis of plasma samples collected from dia-
betes patients on the 2nd and 16th hospital day with GC/MS
was carried out. Plasma samples of volunteers without diabetes
were also analyzed.
All the samples were divided into eight batches after ran-
domization of sample sequences. For each batch, a series of
samples was prepared, as described previously4, and subsequent
metabolite measurements were carried out on a Shimadzu
TQ8040 GC system (Shimadzu Corporation, Kyoto, Japan)
connected to a mass spectrometer in multiple reaction monitor-
ing mode.
N-alkane mix C9–C40 (GL Science Inc., Tokyo, Japan) was
injected in the beginning part of each batch and was analyzed
in scan mode. The result was used to correct the retention time
of each batch. A quality control (QC) sample, which was gener-
ated by mixing the same volume of plasma randomly selected
from the collected plasma samples, was injected after every
three study samples. Each batch also contained a blank sample.
Multiple reaction monitoring transitions are described in
Table S1. The other analytical conditions, such as the column
and the instrument, were described previously4.
Peak detection was carried out using the LabSolutions
Insight (Shimadzu Corporation). Peak height was then used
for quantiﬁcation. Subsequently, each metabolite was calibrated
using the LOWESS/Spline normalization method (http://prime.
psc.riken.jp/compms/others/main.html)
based
on
the
QC
value15.

expressed as counts and percentages. P-values <0.05 were con-
sidered signiﬁcant. Welch’s t-tests were used to evaluate the dif-
ferences between the two groups at baseline for continuous
variables. Paired t-tests were used to differentiate the diabetes
group between the pre-treatment period and post-treatment
period. If the variables were log-normally distributed, the tests
were used after log-transformation. The v2-test was used for
categorical variables.

The metabolites that met the following criteria were included
in the analysis: (i) detection rate in QC samples was ≥70%; (ii)

Metabolome and diabetes treatment

of samples without detection, half of the minimum value of the
metabolite’s intensity in all the samples was substituted. All
metabolite data were then log-transformed.
A principal component analysis was carried out with a statis-
tical analysis tool (http://prime.psc.riken.jp/compms/others/ma
in.html) using the metabolite data of the diabetes group in the
pre-treatment period and of the non-diabetes group. The
metabolite data were used after autoscaling (standardization
with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1). Then, the
metabolite data of the diabetes group in the post-treatment per-
iod were transformed according to the loading score and com-
pared with the principal component analysis data of the
diabetes group in the pre-treatment period and the non-
diabetes group.
To evaluate the effect of inpatient treatment, each
metabolite datum of the diabetes group was compared
between the pre-treatment period and post-treatment per-
iod using paired t-tests. To account for multiple testing,
we used the Benjamini–Hochberg method; that is, we cal-
culated
the
adjusted
P-values
(q-values),
with
the
signiﬁcance level set at 0.05. A volcano plot was con-
structed using the q-values and fold-change values (ratios
between the median of post-treatment values and the med-
ian of pre-treatment values). We then selected the metabo-
lites with a signiﬁcant difference in the paired t-tests and
whose fold-change value was not >90% and <110%.
Finally, to evaluate the association of metabolites from the
perspective of the change caused by treatment, hierarchical
clustering with cosine similarity was carried out using the group
average method. Post-treatment value/pre-treatment value ratio
was used for the analysis after log-transforming. The analysis
was carried out using SPSS Statistics (IBM Corporation,
Armonk, NY, USA).
RESULTS
Participants’ characteristics and effect of a comprehensive
diabetes treatment
Two diabetes patients withdrew the consent after participation;
hence, a total of 31 diabetes patients and 30 volunteers without
diabetes, none of whom had missing data, were included in the
ﬁnal analysis. Their clinical data are shown in Table 1. Diabetes
patients were older, had a higher body mass index and glycated
hemoglobin level, and had a higher prevalence of hypertension
and dyslipidemia than the participants without diabetes. A
comprehensive diabetes treatment carried out in the hospital
resulted in signiﬁcant changes in bodyweight, liver function,
lipid proﬁle, highly sensitive C-reactive protein level and glyce-
mic control of diabetes patients.
Metabolomic analysis
The residual standard deviation of ribitol in all study samples
and QC samples was 6.4%, indicating an extremely high stabil-
ity of GC/MS measurement. Among the 379 target metabolites,
the levels of 135 metabolites peaked. Among these 135 metabo-
lites, 78 met the inclusion criteria and were included in the
analysis.
The principal component analysis results with the data of
the diabetes group in the pre-treatment period and non-
diabetes group are shown in Figure 1a, which revealed that the
metabolomes of the two groups were different.
The results along with the data of the diabetes group in the
post-treatment period are shown in Figure 1b, which indicated
that the metabolome of the post-treatment period was different
from that of the pre-treatment period, as well as that of the
non-diabetes group. As shown in Figure 1b, the ﬁrst principal

Metabolome and diabetes treatment

was likely to be associated with whether the plasma samples
were taken before or after inpatient treatment. The metabolites
with low loading scores of the ﬁrst principal component
include monosaccharides and branched-chain amino acids (Fig-
ure 1c and Table S2). In contrast, several amino acids had high
loading scores of the second principal component, whereas fatty
acids had low loading scores (Figure 1c and Table S3), indicat-
ing that the changes in these metabolites were probably
induced by the inpatient treatment.
The volcano plot (Figure 2) shows the results of the paired
t-tests comparing between metabolite’s intensities in the pre-
treatment and post-treatment period. This analysis indicates
that the metabolites, which decreased over a period of 2 weeks
during the inpatient treatment, consisted of several monosac-
charides, whereas those that increased consisted of several
amino acids.
The dendrograms with a heat map (Figure 3) show the
results of the hierarchical clustering. The cluster in the lower
part consisted mostly of the amino acids, which increased dur-
ing the inpatient treatment (amino acids of red characters),
indicating that they changed in the same way. On the contrary,
the cluster in the upper part consisted mostly of the monosac-
charides, which decreased (monosaccharides of blue characters).
In the case of patients with markedly decreased monosaccha-
ride levels and increased 1,5-anhydroglucitol (shown in bold
letters in Figure 3) levels, the levels of amino acids increased
more signiﬁcantly.
Furthermore, the plasma levels of the amino acids with a sig-
niﬁcant increase after inpatient treatment were compared
among the groups. There were signiﬁcant differences in plasma
levels between the non-diabetes group and the diabetes group
in the post-treatment period, but there was no signiﬁcant differ-
ence between the non-diabetes group and the diabetes group in
the pre-treatment period (Figure S1).
DISCUSSION
In
the
present
GC/MS-based
non-target metabolomics
study, we found that the plasma metabolome of the dia-
betes patients with poor glycemic control were different
from that of the individuals without diabetes. We also
found that the plasma metabolome of the participants with
diabetes had signiﬁcantly changed after the comprehensive
treatment against diabetes, although it was still different
from that of the participants without diabetes. After the
treatment, the plasma levels of many monosaccharides
(e.g., glucose, galactose, fructose and mannose) decreased,
but those of several amino acids (e.g., proline, glycine, ser-
ine, threonine, methionine, pyroglutamic acid, glutamine
and lysine) increased.
In the present study, the levels of monosaccharides, such as
galactose, fructose and mannose, in addition to glucose,
decreased after treatment. This result is partially consistent with
that of a previous study, which reported that the serum level of
a-galactose decreased by rosiglitazone or repaglinide treatment,
mannose decreased by repaglinide treatment, and fructose
increased by rosiglitazone or repaglinide treatment6. In the pre-
sent study, the dendrograms with a heat map (Figure 3) show
that the decrease in the level of monosaccharides belong to the
same cluster, indicating that they decreased in the same way.
Monosaccharides, not restricted to glucose, are catabolized
through glycolysis16, which is promoted by insulin17. Our pre-
sent result of the hierarchical clustering implies that an
improvement in the action of insulin after the treatment pro-
moted glycolysis, resulting in the reduction in the levels of vari-
ous monosaccharides.
Many previous studies reported the relationships between cir-
culating levels of certain amino acids and diabetes. Several of
them showed that elevated blood concentrations of branched-
chain amino acids, such as valine, leucine and isoleucine, and
aromatic amino acids, such as phenylalanine and tyrosine, and
reduced blood concentration of glycine predict the risk of
developing type 2 diabetes18-20. A clinical study using the Fram-
ingham Heart Study Offspring Cohort identiﬁed the valine, leu-
cine, isoleucine, phenylalanine and tyrosine as predictors of
type 2 diabetes18. These branched-chain amino acids and aro-
matic amino acids were also identiﬁed as predictors of insulin
resistance in healthy individuals21. A lower level of glycine was
found to be a predictor of impaired glucose tolerance and
type 2 diabetes in the Cooperative Health Research in the
Region of Augsburg cohort19, and of type 2 diabetes in the
European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition-
Potsdam cohort20. As glycine is an acceptor of the acyl groups
that buffer the excess acyl groups generating acyl-glycine
derivatives, excessive amounts of fatty acyl group with diabetes
leads to glycine consumption followed by a reduction of the
free glycine pool22. However, it remains unclear whether most
of the other amino acids are associated with the pathophysiol-
ogy of diabetes. The present study showed that comprehensive
diabetes treatment increased the plasma levels of many amino
acids, and that no amino acids were decreased. This is the ﬁrst
study to report that the plasma levels of proline, threonine,
methionine and pyroglutamic acid increased after the diabetes
treatment.
Interestingly, the increase in amino acids during diabetes
treatment seems to have been extremely large, as the differences
between pre- and post-treatment were relatively large compared
with those between diabetes patients in the pre-treatment per-
iod and participants without diabetes. The possible underlying
mechanisms of the increase in the levels of amino acids in the
present study were as follows: (i) an increase in the release of
amino acids from the skeletal muscles; and (ii) a reduction in
the use of amino acids in the liver as a consequence of a reduc-
tion of gluconeogenesis.
Muscles and circulating proteins are the major reservoir of
amino acids within the body, and the proteins in the skeletal
muscle and the circulating system are in continuous turnover.
Protein degradation and synthesis of skeletal muscles are con-
trolled
by
circulating
anabolic
and
catabolic
molecules23.

Relative or absolute deﬁciency of insulin, which is one of the
major anabolic molecules that induces protein synthesis, is the
main pathological condition of diabetes. On the contrary, the
expression of catabolic molecules, such as inﬂammatory cytoki-
nes (e.g., tumor necrosis factor-a and interleukin-1b) and hor-
mones (catecholamines and cortisol), which induce protein
degradation, increases in patients with diabetes24. Thus, the
protein metabolism of skeletal muscle in diabetes patients, both
the reduction in anabolic molecules and increase in catabolic
molecules, could lead to protein degradation and release of the
amino acids. Amino acids released from muscles are, then, used
in the liver to produce glucose by gluconeogenesis24. The
increased release from muscles and the increased use through
enhanced gluconeogenesis might be balanced, and thus, there
was no difference in plasma levels of most of the amino acids
with an increase after the inpatient treatment between diabetes
patients in the pre-treatment and participants without diabetes.
Diabetes treatment is considered to improve the insulin action
of skeletal muscle, and reduce the expression of inﬂammatory
cytokines and hormones, attenuating the protein degradation
and the release of the amino acids from skeletal muscle. In the
liver, it might reduce the usage of the amino acids through the
reduction of gluconeogenesis. In the present study, the hierar-
chical clustering analysis showed that an increase in plasma
levels of amino acids was observed in accordance with the
improvement in glycemic control (Figure 3), supporting the
hypothesis that the reduction of gluconeogenesis caused by dia-
betes treatment increased the plasma amino acid levels. The
changes in amino acid and protein metabolism in the skeletal
muscle might have been relatively small. This implies that the
short-term (approximately 2 weeks) comprehensive diabetes
treatment was insufﬁcient to improve amino acid and protein
metabolism in skeletal muscle, although it might have resulted
in the improvement of various metabolic proﬁles, such as glyce-
mic control, lipid proﬁles and liver function. In such a scenario,
a relatively long-term glycemic control might be required. Fur-
thermore, the simultaneous performance of resistance exercise
seems to be important for the improvement of amino acid and
protein metabolism, as it enhances the synthesis of muscle pro-
teins25.
A previous randomized controlled study including obese
adults with impaired fasting glucose or diabetes reported that a
3-month treatment of insulin sensitizer with pioglitazone and
metformin increased the plasma glycine and serine concentra-
tion, and decreased the plasma lysine concentration compared
with a placebo5. Another study showed that 48 weeks of
rosiglitazone treatment increased the serum levels of lysine in
diabetes patients6. Rosiglitazone was also reported to increase
plasma levels of glutamine after 6 weeks of treatment11, as well
as the plasma levels of serum glutamine after 16 weeks of treat-
ment12. Furthermore, rosiglitazone treatment might diminish
the demand for amino acids as substrate for hepatic gluconeo-
genesis11. These ﬁndings suggest that elevation in the plasma
levels of glycine, serine, glutamine and lysine observed in the
present study might be induced by improvement in glycemic
control or insulin resistance itself, but not by diet or exercise.
The present study also had some potential limitations. First,
the present study was a pilot study, and the sample size was
insufﬁcient to draw conclusions. In addition, not diabetes, but
other factors, might cause the difference in metabolome
between the diabetes and the non-diabetes groups, as we were
unable to match clinical characteristics of the two groups.
Second, it remains unclear whether the detected metabolites
and glycemic control have a causal relationship; the present
ﬁndings did not necessarily mean that glycemic control caused
the changes in the plasma levels of metabolomes and vice versa.
Therefore, experimental studies are necessary to investigate the
mechanisms underlying this change.
Third, the possibility that a change in the dietary composi-
tion and physical activity during the hospitalization affected the
plasma levels of amino acids cannot be denied, as we do not
have detailed information about these factors. Blood metabo-
lomes differ between groups who have different dietary compo-
sition26, and diet inﬂuences the metabolism of amino acids27.
In the present study, physical therapy was not provided based
on a standardized protocol; but was prescribed to the patients
by their attending physician according to their respective condi-
tions of glycemic control and diabetic complications. Therefore,
the study might have included patients whose amount of exer-
cise was reduced. Reduction in the amount of exercise might
induce imbalance of protein synthesis and degradation of skele-
tal muscles, and accelerate the release of amino acids into the
blood. However, most of the amino acids released from the
skeletal muscles into the blood as a result of the reduction in
the amount of exercise is alanine28,29. Considering the results
that the plasma level of alanine did not increase in the present
study, the degradation of skeletal muscles might have had little
inﬂuence.
In conclusion, after a 2-week comprehensive treatment, the
plasma levels of various amino acids increased in conjunction
with the reduction in monosaccharide levels in poorly con-
trolled type 2 diabetes patients.
