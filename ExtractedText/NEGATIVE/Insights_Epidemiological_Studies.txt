Abstract: The increasing prevalence of diabetes and its complications, such as cardiovascular and
kidney disease, remains a huge burden globally. Identiﬁcation of biomarkers for the screening,
diagnosis, and prognosis of diabetes and its complications and better understanding of the molecular
pathways involved in the development and progression of diabetes can facilitate individualized
prevention and treatment. With the advancement of analytical techniques, metabolomics can iden-
tify and quantify multiple biomarkers simultaneously in a high-throughput manner. Providing
information on underlying metabolic pathways, metabolomics can further identify mechanisms
of diabetes and its progression. The application of metabolomics in epidemiological studies have
identiﬁed novel biomarkers for type 2 diabetes (T2D) and its complications, such as branched-chain
amino acids, metabolites of phenylalanine, metabolites involved in energy metabolism, and lipid
metabolism. Metabolomics have also been applied to explore the potential pathways modulated by
medications. Investigating diabetes using a systems biology approach by integrating metabolomics
with other omics data, such as genetics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and clinical data can present a
comprehensive metabolic network and facilitate causal inference. In this regard, metabolomics can
deepen the molecular understanding, help identify potential therapeutic targets, and improve the pre-
vention and management of T2D and its complications. The current review focused on metabolomic
biomarkers for kidney and cardiovascular disease in T2D identiﬁed from epidemiological studies,
and will also provide a brief overview on metabolomic investigations for T2D.

1. Introduction
Diabetes affected 463 million people in 2019, and it has been projected that 700 million
adults will have diabetes worldwide by 2045, with the majority being type 2 diabetes
(T2D) [1]. Diabetes is the leading cause of chronic kidney disease (CKD); whereby around
40% of individuals with T2D develop diabetic kidney disease (DKD) [2], and DKD has
become the major cause of end-stage kidney disease (ESKD), contributing to half of new
cases of ESKD each year [3]. Moreover, individuals with T2D have 2- to 4-fold increased
risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and death [4]. A multinational study including
participants from South and East Asia, North Africa, the Middle East, South America,
and Europe reported an approximate 50% prevalence of microvascular complications
and 30% prevalence of macrovascular complications in T2D [5]. DKD characterized by
impaired glomerular ﬁltration rate or albuminuria has been associated with increased risk
of CVD and mortality [6,7]. Furthermore, CVD has been estimated to cause two-thirds of

2 of 38
deaths in T2D [8]. Consequently, T2D has been ranked fourth among the disease burden
worldwide [9], with a 2- to 3-fold increase in medical expenditures [10].
T2D is believed to arise due to complex interactions between genetic information,
developmental exposures and environmental factors such as diet, physical activity, and
pollution [11,12]. Hyperglycemia is the hallmark feature of diabetes and has been utilized
as a screening and diagnostic biomarker for diabetes, however, metabolic alteration leading
to diabetes may be present decades before the onset of hyperglycemia. Modiﬁcation
of lifestyle (diet and physical activity) could delay or even prevent the development of
diabetes [13,14], highlighting the utility of powerful screening biomarkers to identify
individuals at risk of developing diabetes. Given the increasing risks of adverse outcomes
in diabetes and the availability of drugs proven to delay or prevent CVD and DKD [15–17],
it is also critical to identify prognostic biomarkers involved in the pathogenesis of diabetic
complications or predictive of future diabetic complications, which can facilitate clinicians’
decision making and beneﬁt individuals at risk. Biomarkers indicating clinical response
to speciﬁc medications can help identify individuals who may beneﬁt from the therapy
compared with those who have no biological response.
To improve the prevention and risk stratiﬁcation of diabetes and its complications,
as well as to maximize the beneﬁts from interventions, approaches which provide novel
insights into the etiology, diagnosis and prognosis of diabetes are much needed. With
the rapid advancements in analytical techniques, it has become possible to identify and
quantify multiple biomarkers simultaneously in a high-throughput manner, which has
dramatically advanced approaches for biomarker discovery.
2. Metabolomics and Metabolites
In 1971, Linus Pauling and colleagues introduced the concept of using quantitative
and qualitative patterns of metabolites to understand the physiological status within
a biological system [18]. Metabolites (with a small molecular mass < 1500 Da) can be
endogenous compounds that are produced during endogenous catabolism or anabolism,
such as amino acids, peptides, nucleic acids, sugars, lipids, organic acids, and fatty acids
(FAs), as well as exogenous chemicals, such as toxins and xenobiotics. The metabolome is
termed as the complete collection of metabolites in a given biosample. Metabolomics is
the method of comprehensively characterizing the metabolome in cells, organs, bioﬂuids,
or other biological systems. Metabolomics is emerging as an attractive tool for biomarker
discovery in diabetes and its complications, since metabolites can provide information on
the molecular pathways involved in the development and progression of disease.
Multiple factors contribute to the development of diabetes. Most genetic variants
associated with T2D identiﬁed in large genome-wide association studies (GWAS) only
modestly contribute to the risk of diabetes. Among the identiﬁed genetic variants, over
300 common genetic variants collectively explained only 16% of the variance of diabetes in
a study which included around one million individuals of European decent [19]. Metabo-
lites are, in general, the downstream products of gene expression, transcripts, protein
transporters, and enzymatic reactions, which are closely correlated with genes in which a
single deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) base change in a given gene can result in 10,000-fold
change in the level of endogenous metabolites [20] (Figure 1). Besides internal variations,
metabolites can also be affected by exogenous factors, such as diet, lifestyle, physical
activities, gut microbiota, and environmental pollution; thus, the metabolome is believed to
reﬂect the molecular proﬁle most proximal to an individual’s phenotype, since it integrates
information from the genome, transcriptome, proteome, and enzymes as well as exogenous
exposures (Figure 1).

Figure 1. Metabolomics provide a comprehensive molecular proﬁle of a phenotype by integrating both endogenous
and exogenous information. Metabolites are the downstream products of the genome, transcriptome, proteome, and
enzymatic reactions, which are also affected by environmental exposures, such as environmental pollution, physical
activities, medications, and diet. The metabolome is closely correlated with genes in which even one single base change
in a protein-coding gene can result in 10,000-fold change in the level of a metabolite. In contrast to the relatively simple
chemical constitutions of genome (4 nucleotide bases) and proteome (20 proteogenic amino acids), the metabolome consists
of thousands of different chemical classes and the number of metabolites is estimated to be around 1 million, while the
number of genes and proteins are about 20,000 and 620,000, respectively. Thus, metabolomics provides a comprehensive
molecular proﬁle of a phenotype.
With the advances of analytical techniques and statistical approaches, the number of
measurable metabolites has been increasing exponentially over the past 10 years (from
2200 to around 1 million currently) [21]. The application of metabolomics in diabetes
and its complications, especially in large-scale epidemiological studies, has facilitated the
identiﬁcation and validation of metabolites that can serve as screening and prognostic
biomarkers. Moreover, a multi-omics approach, combining metabolomics with other
“omics” data, can provide insights into the complex intercorrelations of different axes
involved in the disease and provide opportunities to elucidate the potential causality
between biomarkers and disease. The current review focuses on metabolomic biomarkers
for kidney and cardiovascular disease in T2D identiﬁed from epidemiological studies,
and will also provide a brief overview on metabolomic biomarkers for T2D identiﬁed in
prospective studies. In the following section, we ﬁrstly introduce the analytical methods
for metabolic proﬁling.
3. Analytical Methods
3.1. Untargeted and Targeted Metabolomics
There are two analytical approaches for metabolomics studies: untargeted and tar-
geted. Untargeted metabolomics represents the unbiased approach to complete proﬁling of
the metabolome, aiming to detect, identify, and quantify as many metabolites in a biological
sample as possible. The major strength of untargeted metabolomics is the possibility of
uncovering novel biomarkers and pathophysiological pathways of disease. However, the
annotation of unknown compounds often becomes a challenge, given the wide coverage
of signals. In contrast, targeted metabolomics aims to measure a prespeciﬁed set or clus-
ter of chemical compounds, which are usually lying on the same metabolic pathways or
are structurally similar. Although only capable of providing limited information on the
metabolic proﬁling, targeted metabolomics in general has higher sensitivity and selectivity,
and can often provide a deeper understanding of the selected metabolites.
3.2. Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Spectroscopy
In sharp contrast to the genome, which comprises of only four nucleotide bases, or
the proteome, which represents the different combinations of 20 proteogenic amino acids,
the metabolome consists of chemical compounds belonging to thousands of different
chemical classes [22] (Figure 1). Given the diverse chemical properties and the wide

Cells 2021, 10, 2832
4 of 38
range of concentrations of metabolites, currently, no single platform can quantify the
entire metabolome. The two most commonly used techniques are NMR spectroscopy and
mass spectrometry (MS), with the latter usually coupled to separation techniques, such
as gas chromatography (GC-MS) or liquid chromatography (LC-MS). NMR works by the
manipulation of the nuclear spin of certain atomic nuclei, such as 1H, 13C, 15N, and 31P, by
exposing them to a strong external magnetic ﬁeld, and then recording the frequency of
electromagnetic radiation released as a result of nuclei relaxation. Because the signal of a
given nucleus is inﬂuenced by the neighboring atoms in a predictable way, the chemical
shifts in its resonance frequency can thus be used to identify the underlying molecular
structure. Since 1H atoms can be found in most of the organic compounds, proton (1H)
NMR spectroscopy (1H NMR) is widely employed in NMR-based metabolomics studies.
NMR is noninvasive and nondestructive, and requires little or no sample preparation,
chromatographic separation, or chemical derivatization; it can also be applied to in vivo
tissues or to living samples, such as the real-time proﬁling of living cells and analysis of
real-time metabolic ﬂux [23,24]. Another advantage of NMR is that NMR is especially
suitable for assessing protein-bound metabolites (i.e., lipoprotein particles), and given the
high automatability and reproducibility, NMR can be applied in large-scale metabolomics
studies [25,26]. The major limitation of NMR, however, is its relatively low sensitivity
(millimole to micromole per liter range), which is approximately 10 to 100 times less
sensitive than MS.
3.3. Mass Spectrometry
The high resolution and sensitivity of MS has made it the most widely used platform
for metabolomic studies [27]. Compounds are ﬁrst separated by chromatographic tech-
niques (i.e., GC or LC) to reduce ion suppression, before quantiﬁcation and identiﬁcation
by the mass spectrometer. GC-MS is a highly sensitive and suitable method for the separa-
tion of volatile and thermally stable metabolites. GC-MS can separate naturally volatile
compounds, such as ketones, aldehydes, alcohols, esters, and furans, and compounds
that can be made volatile by derivatization, such as sugars, amino acids, lipids, and or-
ganic acids [28]. As chemical derivatization may alter the structure of compounds and
unpredictable variations may occur during sample preparation, one of the drawbacks of
GC-MS is its relatively low reproducibility [29]. Compared with GC-MS, LC-MS requires
higher instrument costs, and suffers from lower reproducibility. LC-MS can separate a
wide range of classes of compounds, from very polar to very nonpolar ones [30]. As
compounds in bioﬂuids must be ionized prior to MS measurement, unlike GC-MS which
utilizes the hard-ionization approach (i.e., electron-impact [EI] ionization), LC-MS often
uses soft-ionization methods instead (i.e., electrospray ionization [ESI] and atmospheric
pressure chemical ionization [APCI]), thus generating ions without fragmentation and
allowing the identiﬁcation of unknown compounds [31,32]. Compared to GC-MS, one of
the advantages of LC-MS is that chemical derivatization is not required in most conditions
since high temperatures and volatility are no longer required. Moreover, LC-MS is in
general more sensitive, covering compounds from low molecular weight to molecular
weights beyond 600 Da, including phospholipids, conjugated bile acids, glycosides and
sugars [33]. However, the major drawback of LC-MS as an untargeted platform is the lack
of transferable mass spectral libraries [34]. Compared with NMR, although MS techniques
have higher sensitivity, they are destructive and in general produce results which are
comparatively less reproducible. The major advantages and disadvantages of NMR and
MS techniques for metabolomic proﬁling are summarized in Table 1.

4. Metabolomics in Diabetes
The characteristic perturbations of metabolic homeostasis associated with or preceding
the development of hyperglycemia makes metabolomics a good method to elucidate
the potential pathways and to explore potential biomarkers for T2D. Over the past two
decades, metabolomics has been widely utilized in large epidemiological studies, and some
metabolites/pathways have been identiﬁed and validated to be associated with insulin
metabolism or being predictive of diabetes across different studies [35]. Table 2 summarizes
the ﬁndings from some of key prospective studies [36–66].

4.1. Amino Acids
4.1.1. Branched-Chain Amino Acids (BCAAs)
BCAAs (isoleucine, leucine, and valine) have been found to be altered among obese
vs. lean humans, and were found to contribute to insulin resistance in experimental
studies [67]. First reported in the Framingham Heart Study (FHS) and subsequently
replicated in the Malmö Diet and Cancer study [38], BCAAs and two aromatic amino
acids (AAAs, tyrosine and phenylalanine) were found to be associated with increased
risk of T2D during a 12-year follow-up, and the associations remained signiﬁcant after
adjustment for age, sex, body-mass index (BMI), and fasting glucose [38]. The combination
of three amino acids (isoleucine, tyrosine, and phenylalanine) could predict T2D (odds ratio
[OR] 2.42, 95% conﬁdence interval [CI] 1.66–3.54). Furthermore, compared to individuals
from the lowest quartile, people in the highest quartile had an odds ratio of 5.99 (95%
CI, 2.34–15.34) for diabetes [38]. Multiple studies across different ethnicities have since
replicated the association between BCAAs and risk of diabetes [39,45,47,51–54,57,59,60].
BCAAs have been found to be related to insulin resistance in animal and human studies [68],
however, it remains unclear whether BCAAs contribute to diabetes in a causal manner.
Residual confounding and reverse causation in observational studies often hamper the
causal inference between biomarkers and outcomes. Using genetic variants mimicking
the life-time effects of an environmental exposure which are ﬁxed at conception as the
instrumental variable, Mendelian randomization (MR) studies have been utilized to explore
the potential causal link between exposures and outcomes. One MR study found that a GRS
(genetic risk score) for insulin resistance causally increased BCAAs levels, while genetically
increased BCAAs were not associated with insulin resistance [69]. Another two-sample
MR study further supported a causal link between insulin resistance and BCAAs [70].
Despite lacking a direct causal link with diabetes, these results suggest that BCAAs may
lie on the causal pathway from insulin resistance to diabetes by mediating the effect of
insulin resistance on the development of diabetes, since BCAAs levels have been found to
be increased by obese microbiomes, and there is decreased oxidation in the adipose tissue
and liver in people with insulin resistance [71] (Figure 2). BCAAs may therefore serve as
predictive biomarkers, especially given their levels may be increased as early as a decade
before overt diabetes.
Figure 2. The role of BCAAs in the progression from insulin resistance to type 2 diabetes. In mendelian randomization
studies, genetically predicted insulin resistance increased BCAAs, rather than the reverse. BCAAs oxidation in adipose
tissue and liver was decreased in people with insulin resistance, leading to elevated circulating BCAAs. Obese microbiomes
could elevate BCAAs. One of the BCAAs, leucine, could activate the mTOR pathway. The above ﬁndings suggest a potential
mediating role of BCAAs in the progression from insulin resistance to type 2 diabetes. Increased BCAAs oxidation in skeletal
muscle depletes the intracellular pool of glycine and increases 3-hydroxyisobutyrate production, resulting in skeletal muscle
lipotoxicity, which may be the mechanism linking BCAAs and insulin resistance. BCAAs, branched-chain amino acids; MR,

4.1.2. Aromatic Amino Acids
Tyrosine and phenylalanine, two kinds of AAAs, have also been associated with
risk of diabetes [38,39,45,47,49,54,56,59,60]. Analyses in individuals with normal fasting
glucose from the FHS found a positive association between phenylalanine and future
diabetes, and the consistent ﬁndings in MR studies further supported a potential causal
role of phenylalanine in the pathogenesis of diabetes [58]. A breakdown product of
phenylalanine, 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl) lactate, has been found to be associated with decreased
insulin secretion and diabetes in the Metabolic Syndrome in Men (METSIM) study [63].
Results from the Southall Additionally, Brent Revisited (SABRE) study suggested a stronger
association of tyrosine with diabetes in South Asians than in Europeans, indicating that
the metabolic proﬁle may differ between different ethnicities, and that metabolites may
be helpful towards exploring ethnic differences in diabetes incidence. Tyrosine may be an
ideal predictive biomarker for diabetes in South Asians [45].
4.1.3. Other Amino Acids
Glycine, a nonessential amino acid [72], was found to be inversely associated with
diabetes in Europeans [40,42,47,58], whereas a positive association has been reported in
a Chinese population [51]. The MR analysis from the FHS suggested a potential causal
link between glycine and diabetes, with the genetically predicted glycine being inversely
associated with risk of diabetes [58]. However, a study including 74,124 T2D cases and
824,006 controls did not ﬁnd an association between genetically predicted glycine and
diabetes risk [73]. Furthermore, the study found that genetically higher insulin resistance
was associated with lower levels of glycine, suggesting a mediating role of glycine between
insulin resistance and diabetes [73]. Alanine, a nonessential amino acid synthesized from
pyruvate and BCAAs, has also been reported to be associated with diabetes [39,47,49,54,56].
Glutamate, synthesized from α-ketoglutaric acid in the citric acid cycle, has been found to
be associated with the risk of diabetes [47,52,60] and a reverse association of glutamine,
a transamination product of glutamate, has been reported [39,52]. The biological roles of
these amino acids in the development of diabetes are, however, yet to be elucidated.
4.2. Organic Acids
Alpha-hydroxybutyrate, a product of threonine and methionine, upstream of the
tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, has been associated with impaired glucose tolerance and
diabetes [41,50,52,53,63]. Ketone bodies are an important alternative energy source during
fasting, and levels of ketone bodies represent the balance of production (ketogenesis)
and utilization (ketolysis). Acetoacetate, converted from free fatty acids (FFAs), has been
associated with impaired insulin secretion and diabetes [43].
4.3. Lipids
4.3.1. Lipoproteins
Individuals with T2D commonly exhibit dyslipidemia, namely, high levels of triglyc-
erides and small dense LDL particles, low levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) choles-
terol, and normal or near-normal low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels [74].
NMR has emerged as a novel method to measure lipoprotein particles [75], and has been
applied in investigations on lipoproteins and onset of diabetes. In the Insulin Resistance
Atherosclerosis Study (IRAS), very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) size and small HDL
were associated with increased risk of diabetes, independent of triglycerides and HDL
cholesterol in prediabetic subjects [36]. In the Women’s Health Study (WHS), both lipopro-
tein particle size and concentration have been associated with incident diabetes during
13-year follow-up; VLDL size, total/large/small VLDL concentration, and small LDL and
HDL were positively associated with diabetes, while large LDL and HDL were inversely
associated [37]. Analyses from Finnish populations have also found a positive association
for VLDL and a negative association for HDL [46,59]. Recent analyses from the Prevention
of Renal and Vascular End-Stage Disease (PREVEND) study with detailed HDL subspecies

Cells 2021, 10, 2832
14 of 38
measurements reported heterogeneous associations between HDL subclasses and inci-
dent diabetes: larger HDL size and particles were associated with lower risk of incident
diabetes [66].
4.3.2. Fatty Acids
FFAs are produced during hydrolysis of triglycerides [76]. Under the insulin-resistant
state, increased lipolysis leads to overproduction of FFAs. In the METSIM study, saturated
FAs were associated with increased risk of diabetes, while an inverse association has been
found between unsaturated FAs and diabetes [44]. Furthermore, monounsaturated FAs
(MUFAs%) were associated with risk of diabetes in a prospective study combining four
Finnish cohorts over 8–15 years of follow-up, and polyunsaturated FAs (PUFAs%), mainly
n-6 FAs, were associated with decreased risk of diabetes [59]. A two-sample MR study
suggested potential causal associations between FAs and fasting glucose, beta cell function,
and diabetes [77]. Genetically predicted linoleic acid, the main n-6 PUFAs, has been consis-
tently associated with lower risk of diabetes in a two-sample MR using different genetic
variants and analytical approaches [78]. FAs can be derived from dietary triglycerides and
phospholipids and dietary counselling has been shown to modify circulating FAs levels [79].
With possible causal links with diabetes, FAs may be emerging as new intervention targets
for the prevention of diabetes.
5. Metabolomics in Diabetic Kidney Disease
The kidneys are metabolically active organs involved in modulating the circulating
levels of metabolites through ﬁltration, reabsorption, secretion, and metabolism (including
catabolism and anabolism). Consequently, changes in metabolite concentrations may reﬂect
kidney function, and these changes may even precede the onset or progression of kidney
disease, hence providing insights into the development and progression of DKD. Creatinine
is one of the commonly applied metabolites that is freely ﬁltered at the glomerulus, and not
reabsorbed, with only limited secretion by tubules [80]. Serum creatinine can be used to
estimate glomerular ﬁltration rate (eGFR) noninvasively, however, creatinine is signiﬁcantly
increased at more advanced stages of CKD (CKD stage three and onward) and is affected
by age, sex, race, and muscle mass. The identiﬁcation of early markers is warranted given
the availability of treatments which can prevent and delay DKD progression. Metabolomic
studies have been applied to investigate blood or urine metabolomic biomarkers for DKD
and have provided novel insights into the mechanisms leading to DKD and its progression,
which make potential therapeutic targets possible. Table 3 summarized metabolomic
investigations in DKD [81–107].

5.1. Amino Acids
5.1.1. Asymmetric Dimethylarginine (ADMA) and Symmetric Dimethylarginine (SDMA)
ADMA (an inhibitor of nitric oxide [NO] syntheses) and SDMA are arginine metabo-
lites formed during enzymatic methylation of arginine residuals. SDMA is a structural
isomer of ADMA and is excreted directly by the kidney without any metabolism. A higher
serum level of SDMA has been found in people with DKD [82] and SDMA or its ratio to
ADMA was predictive of rapid kidney function decline in T2D, independent of baseline
eGFR and albuminuria [89,101]. ADMA is metabolized into citrulline and dimethylamine
in the kidneys and has been associated with rapid kidney function decline in T2D, possibly
due to endothelial dysfunction [101].
5.1.2. Aromatic Amino Acids
Both tryptophan (an essential amino acid) and its downstream metabolites, such as
kynurenine, are altered in DKD [88,89,91,93,102,103]. Impaired kidney function upregu-
lates tryptophan metabolism pathways and results in increased kynurenine production,
stimulating leukocyte activation, cytokine production, oxidative stress, and inﬂamma-
tion [108] (Figure 3). Higher serum levels of tryptophan (or tryptophan/kynurenine) have
been found to be inversely associated with rapid eGFR decline in patients with DKD at
baseline, independent of baseline renal function [89,102]. Similarly, elevated levels of
tryptophan downstream metabolites were positively associated with DKD progression
both in patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D) and T2D [88,91,93].
 
Figure 3. Tryptophan metabolic pathway and development and progression of CKD. Tryptophan is an essential amino
acid that cannot be synthesized in the body. A minor fraction of tryptophan (<5%) is metabolized by the indole pathway
to produce indoxyl sulfate. Most tryptophan (around 95%) is metabolized by the kynurenine pathway. Downstream
metabolites of tryptophan, including indoxyl sulfate, kynurenic acid, picolinic acid, xanthurenic acid, quinolinic acid, and
NAD, contribute to oxidative stress, inﬂammation, and immune response, which lead to the development and progression
of CKD. CKD, chronic kidney disease; NAD, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide.
Tyrosine and phenylalanine have also been associated with kidney function and al-
buminuria in patients with diabetes. A meta-analysis of ﬁve cohorts of patients with T2D
found a strong inverse association between phenylalanine and baseline eGFR after a com-

Cells 2021, 10, 2832

prehensive adjustment for confounding variables, including albuminuria [106], in line with
a study comprising three cohorts of patients with T2D [97]. Analyses from the Action in
Diabetes and Vascular Disease: Preterax and Diamicron Modiﬁed Release Controlled Eval-
uation (ADVANCE) trial found a crude association of phenylalanine with macrovascular
disease and all-cause mortality in T2D, however, adjustment for cardiovascular risk factors
attenuated the associations, and phenylalanine was not associated with microvascular
disease prospectively [95]. Tyrosine is synthetized by the hydroxylation of phenylalanine
through phenylalanine hydroxylase. In the setting of CKD, dysfunctional activity of pheny-
lalanine hydroxylase leads to impaired conversion of phenylalanine to tyrosine, resulting
in higher phenylalanine and lower tyrosine [109]. In contrast to phenylalanine, tyrosine
has been both cross-sectionally [106] and prospectively [93,95] associated with DKD. A
higher level of tyrosine has been associated with higher baseline eGFR [106] and lower
risk of microvascular disease in ADVANCE [95]. The downstream metabolite of tyrosine
(o-sulfotyrosine) has been positively associated with ESKD in a Joslin proteinuria cohort
including patients with T1D, proteinuria and stage three CKD [93].
5.1.3. Other Amino Acids
Leucine and isoleucine have been inversely associated with baseline eGFR in patients
with T2D using NMR [106]. However, a study from Steno Diabetes Center Copenhagen
using GC-MS found that BCAAs were associated with lower risk of a combined endpoint
(kidney dysfunction or all-cause mortality) in patients with T1D [99]. A study from
ADVANCE also found that leucine and valine were inversely associated with all-cause
mortality in patients with T2D, while alanine, synthesized from BCAAs, was inversely
associated with microvascular disease, indicating the complex interactions between BCAAs
and diabetes and its complications [95]. Threonine, an essential amino acid involved in
the production of glycine, has been associated with lower risk of rapid eGFR decline in
patients with T1D [102], and the downstream metabolite of threonine (n-acetylthreonine)
was predictive of fast eGFR decline in patients with T2D [91] and ESKD in patients with
T1D [93].
5.1.4. Organic Acids Involved in Energy Metabolism
Uracil, a pyrimidine derivative, was altered in urine samples from patients with
DKD [85,92]. Pseudouridine, synthesized from uracil, showed association with eGFR
decline and urinary albumin–creatinine ratio (UACR) increase in patients with T2D [91]
and ESKD in patients with T1D or T2D from studies in Joslin [88,93]. 3-hydroxyisobutyrate,
a catabolic intermediate of valine which is produced in mitochondria, has been shown
to be altered in patients with DKD [85] and has been found to be associated with ESKD
in patients with diabetes in the Chronic Renal Insufﬁciency Cohort (CRIC) Study [105].
Alpha-hydroxybutyrate, positively associated with insulin resistance and diabetes as men-
tioned above, however, has been found to be associated with lower risk of ESKD in patients
with T2D [88]. Glycine has been found to be reduced in urine samples from patients
with established DKD [92], and glycolic acid, an intermediate of glycine, was also re-
duced [85,92] and was associated with ESKD in analyses from CRIC [105]. Acetoacetate
has also been inversely associated with baseline eGFR in patients with T2D [106], and
2-methylacetoacetate, an intermediate of isoleucine metabolism, was reduced in urine from
patients with DKD [85]. The abovementioned metabolites are all produced in the mito-
chondria and are involved in energy metabolism, suggesting that mitochondrial function
is dysregulated in DKD.
5.2. Lipids
5.2.1. Lipoproteins
HDL particles and their composition (cholesterol and apolipoprotein A1) have been
found to be cross-sectionally associated with higher baseline eGFR in studies combining
several T2D cohorts using NMR, whereas triglyceride-rich lipoproteins and their lipid

Cells 2021, 10, 2832
23 of 38
components were inversely associated, and HDL particles were also negatively associated
with albuminuria [97,106]. A two-sample MR study using the Global Lipids Genetics
Consortium (n = 188,577) and the CKD Genetics Consortium (n = 133,814) suggested a
causal link between HDL cholesterol and better kidney function: genetically increased
HDL cholesterol was associated with 0.8% higher eGFR and lower risk of incident CKD,
and this ﬁnding was robust in all the sensitivity analyses; however, there was no strong
evidence supporting causal associations of LDL cholesterol and triglycerides with baseline
eGFR/UACR or incident CKD [110].
5.2.2. Phospholipids
Phosphatidylcholine (PC) and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) are the two most abun-
dant phospholipids of mammalian cell types, comprising 40–50% and 15–25% of the total
cellular phospholipids, respectively [111]. A case–control study found lower plasma levels
of PCs metabolites in patients with T2D and overt DKD (macroalbuminuria or CKD),
and this ﬁnding was replicated in another group of patients [90]. A prospective analysis
from the Cooperative Health Research in the Region of Augsburg (KORA) also found that
serum PCs were predictive of incident CKD in hyperglycemic patients, independent of
conventional risk factors [104]. Unsaturated PEs have been found to be distinguishable
between progressors (≥40% eGFR reduction) and nonprogressors in patients with T2D and
baseline eGFR ≥90 mL/min/1.73 m2 [98]. Sphingolipids are also important constituents
of cell membranes and have been involved in cell signaling and activation. Ceramides, the
essential precursors of sphingolipids, and sphingomyelin, the most common sphingolipids,
were altered in patients with DKD. Higher plasma levels of ceramide metabolites have
been reported in patients with DKD [90]; studies from the Diabetes Control and Compli-
cations Trial (DCCT) study found that higher plasma levels of very-long-chain ceramides
were associated with incident macroalbuminuria in patients with T1D during 14–20 years
of follow-up [87]. Sphingomyelin level has been found to be elevated in patients with
DKD [84] and was associated with incident CKD in hyperglycemic patients [104] and
progression of DKD in patients with T1D [107].
5.2.3. Fatty Acids and Acylcarnitines
Apart from the link between insulin resistance and diabetes, FFAs have also been
found to be predictive of DKD progression. Among patients with T2D and baseline eGFR
≥90 mL/min/1.73 m2, unsaturated FFAs were associated with lower risk of ≥40% eGFR
reduction during follow-up [98]. Although associated with macrovascular events and
death, FAs were however, not associated with microvascular events or onset or worsening
of nephropathy in the ADVANCE trial [112]. Acylcarnitines, involved in the β-oxidation
of FAs in the mitochondria and barely detectable in nonpathological conditions, have
also been found to be elevated in DKD [90]. C16-acylcarnitine was a strong predictor of
fast eGFR decline in patients with T2D and CKD at baseline, independent of traditional
risk factors [89]. Disturbed lipid metabolism (remodeling of sphingolipid or impaired
β-oxidation of FAs) indicates once again the perturbation of energy metabolism and the
role of mitochondrial dysfunction in the development and progression of DKD.
5.3. Sodium–Glucose Cotransporter-2 Inhibitors (SGLT2i)
SGLT2i reduced the risk of albuminuria and progression of DKD in patients with T2D
in multiple clinical trials [15,113,114], however, its underlying effective pathways remain
unclear. Metabolomics have been applied to explore potential molecular mechanisms
mediating the protective effects of SGLT2i on DKD. Dapagliﬂozin has been suggested
to improve mitochondrial function. Levels of a panel of urinary metabolites previously
linked to mitochondrial dysfunction were increased after 6-week of treatment using GC-
MS [115]. A study combining metabolomics (plasma) and transcriptomics (kidney biopsy)
found three pathways linked with energy metabolism or mitochondrial function have
been affected by dapagliﬂozin, namely, glycine degradation (mitochondrial function),

Cells 2021, 10, 2832
24 of 38
tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA cycle) II (energy metabolism), and L-carnitine biosynthesis
(energy metabolism) [116]. The improvement of mitochondrial function by SGLT2i as the
underlying mechanism to delay the development and progression of DKD further supports
the observation that mitochondria play a role in DKD.
5.4. Current Challenges in Metabolomics Studies in DKD
The kidney itself can modulate the metabolic pathways, which as a result, affects
the levels of circulating metabolites. Furthermore, the deﬁnition of CKD in most of the
current studies is based on eGFR rather than the measured glomerular ﬁltration rate, while
eGFR is insufﬁcient to reﬂect early kidney dysfunction. Although changes in metabolites
may precede the onset or progression of DKD, they may be resulted from early DKD
which is not reﬂected by clinical manifestations or the surrogate markers (i.e., eGFR). For
example, tyrosine is positively associated with baseline eGFR [106], as improved kidney
function induces increased production of tyrosine from phenylalanine [109]. Tyrosine and
its downstream metabolites are also predictive of onset or worsening of nephropathy [95]
and ESKD [93], which may be due to the link between tyrosine and kidney function,
that tyrosine metabolism as a reﬂection of kidney function can predict renal outcomes
rather than being a physiological pathway. The complex interplay between the kidney and
metabolites makes causal inference difﬁcult. However, some metabolites are predictive of
DKD independent of baseline eGFR and albuminuria, highlighting their value as prognostic
biomarkers. Moreover, the lack of large, prospective cohort studies and independent
replications limit the interpretations of these observations and clinical utility of potential
biomarkers.
6. Metabolomics in Cardiovascular Disease
The heart is responsible for around 10% of the fuel consumption of whole body [117]
and beats around 2.5 to 4 billion times over an average human life, even though myocardial
energy stores are only enough for several heart beats [118]. To meet these high energy
need, the heart consumes more than 20 g of carbohydrates and 30 g of fat per day and
uses 35 L of oxygen to generate adenosine triphosphate (ATP) [117]. The metabolism in
the heart is highly ﬂexible, such that it can alter the energy utilization rapidly to adapt
to the changes in environment via using different kinds of energy substrates, including
glucose, fatty acids, ketone bodies, and amino acids [119]. The perturbations of metabolism
in the heart can usually be reﬂected by the changes in the involved circulating metabolites.
Detection and quantiﬁcation of these metabolites provide a way to investigate the under-
lying pathogenic mechanisms of CVD. Moreover, some of the metabolites have potential
to be biomarkers (i.e., screening, diagnostic, or prognostic biomarkers). Metabolomics
have been comprehensively applied in studying CVD in the general population and CVD
cohorts [119,120]. Table 4 summarizes metabolomics studies in CVD in people with dia-
betes [95,107,112,121–127].

6.1. Amino Acids
6.1.1. ADMA
ADMA has been found to be elevated in patients with CVD and associated with
higher odds of CVD in a cross-sectional study of patients with T2D [122]. ADMA was also
predictive of cardiovascular events (CVE) in patients with T2D [124] and patients with
T1D and DKD [123]. Higher risks of faster eGFR decline and ESKD in patients with higher
ADMA [123] suggest that endothelial dysfunction may be a shared mechanism responsible
for vascular complications (cardiorenal complications) in diabetes.
6.1.2. Other Amino Acids
Besides the link with diabetes, BCAAs, tyrosine, and phenylalanine have been found
to be associated with intima-media thickness and incident CVD in population-based stud-
ies [128–130]. Higher phenylalanine was associated with risk of macrovascular outcomes
and all-cause mortality after adjustment for age, sex, region, and randomized treatment
in the ADVANCE trial, however, further adjustment for other cardiovascular risk factors
attenuated the association [95]. Glutamine and histidine, inversely associated with dia-
betes [39,52], were also inversely associated with macrovascular outcomes in ADVANCE,
although adjustment for risk factors attenuated the associations [95]. Although negatively
associated with kidney function [106], phenylalanine has been associated with higher
risk of incident heart failure and showed added value on the risk-stratiﬁcation of heart
failure [131]. A CVD index composed of six amino acids (ethanolamine, hydroxyproline,
glutamic acid, 3-methylhistidine, tyrosine, and tryptophan) was predictive of CVD [125].
The altered levels of amino acids in diabetes, DKD and CVD might suggest some shared
pathways or mechanisms leading to diabetes and its complications.
6.2. Lipids
6.2.1. HDL
Despite the inverse association between HDL cholesterol and risk of CVD in epi-
demiological studies, MR studies and randomized clinical trials to raise HDL cholesterol
level failed to ﬁnd a protective effect of HDL cholesterol on CVD [132–139]. HDL parti-
cles are highly heterogeneous in size, structure, composition, and function [140]. Recent
structural and functional studies suggested that the biological function of HDL particles
differed in size with small, dense, and protein-rich HDL particles involved in the ﬁrst
step of reverse cholesterol transport (RCT) by mediating the effect of ATP-binding cassette
transporter A1 (ABCA1) [141,142]. Besides mediating RCT from macrophages, small HDL
particles also have anti-inﬂammatory, antioxidant, and endothelial protective functions
(Figure 4) [143–146]. In line with this, small HDL particles have been found to be inversely
associated with CVD, stroke, CV death, or all-cause mortality in some well-established
studies [147–154]. Nevertheless, contrasting ﬁndings have also been reported [155,156].
There seems to be a bidirectional relationship between T2D and HDL whereby diabetes
could also modulate the composition and function of HDL [157]. Concentration of large
HDL particle and HDL particle size have been found to be increased in patients with
T1D compared with participants without diabetes, while small HDL and total HDL par-
ticle concentration were reduced [158]. A nested case–control study from the Pittsburgh
Epidemiology of Diabetes Complications Study found that HDL particle subclasses were
predictive of incident coronary artery disease in patients with T1D [121]. Large HDL parti-
cle size was associated with risk of death in the Catheterization Genetics (CATHGEN) study
and a positive association has been found between higher large HDL particle concentration
and death in patients with preserved-ejection-fraction heart failure and patients without
heart failure, even after stringent Bonferroni correction and comprehensive adjustment
including HDL cholesterol [147]. A nested case–control study from the Prevención con
Dieta Mediterránea (PREDIMED) cohort measured HDL functional characteristics and
found that lower levels of HDL function markers were associated with higher odds of
acute coronary syndrome independent of HDL cholesterol in patients at high CV risk [159].

Taken together, despite a complex interplay between diabetes and HDL, HDL particles
or function, rather than simply HDL cholesterol, may be of potential to be prognostic
biomarkers and therapeutic targets for CVD (Figure 4). More studies are warranted in
this area.
Figure 4. Dysfunctional HDL and cardiovascular disease. HDL are highly heterogeneous in size, structure, composition,
and function. Altered lipid composition, protein components, and sizes result in dysfunctional HDL. Decreased cholesterol
efﬂux from macrophages, antioxidant and anti-inﬂammatory capacity, and endothelial protective function of HDL induce
atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease. HDL, high-density lipoprotein.
6.2.2. Fatty Acids and Phospholipids
FAs, including n-3 FAs and docosahexaenoic acid, were inversely associated with
macrovascular events in a study from ADVANCE, with the associations mainly driven by
the associations with CV death and nonfatal stroke [112]. An inverse association between
n-3 FAs and death has also been reported [112], indicating the potential of FAs as prognostic
biomarkers for CVD in patients with diabetes. Further exploration of the causal role of FAs
on CVD may help conﬁrm whether FAs may be therapeutic targets. Apart from the link
with progression of DKD, sphingomyelin has been found to be associated with incident
coronary heart disease, although further adjustment for CV risk factors attenuated the
association [107].
7. Intercorrelation of Metabolomic Biomarkers: Limited Predictive Value
Although independent of traditional risk factors, the selected biomarkers usually
provided limited predictive value when added over models comprised of conventional risk
factors or established risk equations [59,130,131,160]. The highest quantile of a weighted
multimetabolite score (0.320 × phenylalanine—0.474 × non-esteriﬁed cholesterol in large
HDL-0.321 × ratio of cholesteryl esters to total lipids in large VLDL) could predict incident
T2D during 15-year follow-up (OR 5.80 [2.22, 15.1]) compared with the lowest quantile, after
adjusting for risk factors including BMI, fasting glucose, triglycerides, HDL cholesterol,
and HOMA-IR [59]. Addition of the metabolite score over a model including the above-
mentioned predictors improved the discrimination and reclassiﬁcation, with signiﬁcantly

Cells 2021, 10, 2832
29 of 38
improved integrated discrimination improvement (IDI) and continuous net reclassiﬁcation
improvement (NRI), though the increase in c-statistic was modest and not signiﬁcant (0.012,
p = 0.13) [59]. Despite being predictive of adverse outcomes in patients with diabetes, most
of the metabolites (sphingomyelin, amino acids and FAs) failed to increase the c-statistic
on top of established risk factors [95,107,112]. As demonstrated by Wang and colleagues,
the key determinant of the predictive value of multiple biomarkers was the degree of
correlation between biomarkers [161,162]. To improve the c-statistic by 0.05, more than
50 moderately correlated (r = 0.4) biomarkers were needed; while when the biomarkers
were weakly correlated (r = 0.05), less than 10 biomarkers would be needed to increase the
c-statistic by 0.05. Metabolites identiﬁed may be enriched in well-recognized pathways
associated with diabetes and its complications (DKD and CVD), such as insulin resistance,
energy metabolism, cholesterol biosynthesis and transportation, inﬂammation, and kidney
function [163]. Although biomarkers from a shared pathway may indicate the mechanistic
role and therapeutic potential of the pathway, intercorrelation with established risk factors
can limit their contribution to the predictive value of a model already including those risk
factors [163].
8. Systems Biology: Integrating Multidimensional Data
With advancement in technologies, the availability of multi-omics data such as se-
quencing data (gene and ribonucleic acid), proteomics, metabolomics, and lipidomics has
made it possible to investigate diabetes and its complications using a systems biology
approach [164]. A proportion of interindividual variability of metabolite concentrations
can be explained by genetics. Variants identiﬁed in a large GWAS can account for up to
23% of the variance of metabolite concentrations [165]. Analysis performed in a Finnish
Twin Cohort study found that the heritability estimates ranged between 23–55% for amino
acids and other small-molecule metabolites and 48–76% for lipids and lipoproteins [166].
Some loci even explained up to 36% of the variance in circulating metabolites [167]. By
using genetic variants associated with metabolites identiﬁed in GWAS as instrumental
variables, MR can be utilized to make causal inferences with observational data. As ge-
netic variants are randomly assigned during meiosis and ﬁxed at conception, MR can
overcome issues of residual confounding or reverse causality commonly observed in
epidemiological studies [168]. If a metabolite is causally associated with diabetes or its
complications, it may become possible to identify potential drugs targeting the underlying
mechanism as a new treatment strategy. Moreover, the integration of multi-omics data or
even clinical data using systems biology approaches may identify previously unappreciated
inter-relationships between different biological or molecular pathways. For example, by
combining metabolomics and transcriptomics via a metabolite–protein interaction network,
four pathways associated with eGFR have been identiﬁed to be affected by dapagliﬂozin,
which might shine a light on the potential renoprotective mechanisms of SGLT2i [116]. In
contrast to the rapid development of “omics” technologies, statistical and computational
techniques required to handle high-dimensional data, however, remain a major challenge
and bottleneck [169].
9. Exogenous Metabolites, Gut Microbiota, and Diabetes and Its Progression
Exogenous inputs, such as food intake, affect the levels of circulating metabolites [170]
and it has been increasingly appreciated that the gut microbiota play a key role in modify-
ing the metabolome and metabolic homeostasis. Dietary phosphatidylcholines, including
betaine, choline, and trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO), have been found to be altered in
individuals with CVD and appear to promote development of atherosclerosis [171]. Higher
plasma TMAO by LC-MS was also associated with CVE in patients with T2D [127]. A recent
bidirectional two-sample MR found that genetically predicted TMAO was not associated
with T2D, CKD, or CVD, whereas T2D and CKD were causally associated with higher
TMAO, indicating that TMAO may play a mediating role between diabetes/CKD and
CVD [172]. Using untargeted LC-MS, more microbial metabolites have been found to be

Cells 2021, 10, 2832
30 of 38
predictive of incident diabetes in the METSIM study [63]. Studies integrating metabolomics
with genetics and gut microbiota have been implemented to explore the interplay be-
tween genetic variants, dietary intake, gut microbiome and metabolites in diabetes and its
complications [65,103].
10. Conclusions and Perspectives
Metabolomic studies present the molecular characterization of diabetes and its com-
plications and could elucidate underlying pathological pathways that are perturbed in a
disease state. Metabolomics, especially using the untargeted approach, can provide a global
metabolic snapshot and may identify previously unknown molecules that are involved in
the development and progression of diabetes. Metabolomic studies, as mentioned above,
have identiﬁed biomarkers for the screening, diagnosis, and prediction of diabetes and its
complications; some metabolites could also be biomarkers for monitoring the therapeutic
effects of treatment. If being causal of a disease, the associated pathways could even be
considered therapeutic targets. The integration of genetics, transcriptomics, proteomics,
metabolomics, or even clinical data in a systems approach may present a comprehensive
metabolic network of cardiometabolic disease. In this regard, metabolomics is a powerful
approach which can deepen the molecular understanding of and improve efforts towards
preventing or improving clinical management of T2D and its complications.
